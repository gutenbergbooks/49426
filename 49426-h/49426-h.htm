<h2 class="p2">A COUNTRY IDYL.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">IN THE midst of New England mountains,
covered with pine and cedar, lies the quiet
town of Nineveh, looking towards the sea.
Years ago it had mills where lumber was sawed
and grain was ground; but now the old wheels
alone are left, the dams are broken, and the
water falls over the scattered rocks, making
music in harmony with the winds among the
pines. The houses have gone to decay; the
roofs have fallen in, leaving the great, rough
chimneys standing like the Druid towers of
Ireland.</p>

<p>In one of these old houses, before the young
men of New England had gone West to seek
their fortunes, lived a miller and his wife. The
Crandall family were happy, save that no children
had come into the home. Finally a sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of the wife died, bequeathing her little girl to
the Nineveh household.</p>

<p>Nellie Crandall grew from babyhood the
picture of health, an innocent, cheerful girl, in
sweet accord with the daisies of the fields and
the old-fashioned flowers she cared for in her
foster-mother’s garden.</p>

<p>In the house across the way lived John
Harding, a tall, awkward boy, the pride of the
country school for his good scholarship, and in
principle as strong as the New England hills he
lived among.</p>

<p>John and Nellie had played together from
childhood. He had made chains for her neck
of the pine needles; she had fastened golden
coreopsis in his homespun coat; and, while no
word had been spoken, the neighboring people
expected that a new house would sometime be
built in Nineveh, and a young couple begin
anew the beautiful commonplaces of life.</p>

<p>There was considerable excitement one morning
in the quiet town. Byron Marshall, a city
youth, had come to Nineveh to visit the Monroe
family, cousins of the Hardings. Byron
was a handsome, slender lad, well-mannered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
just leaving college and ready for a profession.
He met Nellie Crandall, and was pleased with
the natural country girl.</p>

<p>“No good’ll come of it,” said one of the old
ladies of Nineveh. “I never believed in mismating.
John Harding would give his life for
that girl, while the city youth, I know, is a
selfish fellow.”</p>

<p>The summer wore away with rides and picnics,
and if John’s heart was pained at the
attentions given to Nellie, and accepted by her,
he said nothing.</p>

<p>After Byron’s return to the city a correspondence
was begun by him.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, when John came as
usual to see Nellie, and they were sitting in the
moonlight beside the old mill at the bridge, he
said abruptly, “I’m going away from home,
Nellie. I have begun to think you wouldn’t
mind since Byron came.”</p>

<p>“But I do mind,” said the girl. “I like
Bryon, and he seems fond of me; but, John, I
don’t want you to go, we’ve been such good
friends.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we must be all in all to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
other or I can’t stay. I’ve loved you all these
years with never a thought of another. I’ve
loved every flower in your garden because you
have tended it. This old mill seems precious
because you have sat here. All Nineveh is
sacred to me because it is your home, but I
cannot stay here now.”</p>

<p>Nellie was young; she had seen little of the
world, did not know the true from the false,
and, half captivated with the college youth, she
dare not give her promise to John.</p>

<p>They parted in the moonlight, he heavy of
heart at going and she regretting that two
loved her. John went to a distant State and
found employment. No word came from him,
and Nellie, who missed him sadly, depended
more than ever on the letters which came from
Byron.</p>

<p>The next summer Byron spent at Nineveh,
and it was talked about the little town that
Nellie was engaged, and would soon be a city
lady, living in comfort and prominence.</p>

<p>Two years later there was a wedding at the
Crandall home, and the pretty bride said good-by
to the old mill and the great pines, and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the miller and his wife desolate. Two years
afterwards, when she brought back a little son,
named Samuel, after the miller, they were in a
measure comforted, though they never liked
Byron as well as John, “who was of their kind.”</p>

<p>When John Harding knew that Nellie was
really lost to him and married to another, he,
longing for companionship, married a worthy
girl, prospered in business, and was as happy
as a man can be who does not possess the
power to forget. He had learned what most
of us learn sooner or later&mdash;that life does not
pass according to our plan, plan we ever so
wisely; that, broken and marred, we have to
take up the years and make the mosaic as perfect
as we can.</p>

<p>As time passed some of the Nineveh families
died, and some moved away to other and busier
scenes. Samuel Crandall had been laid in the
little cemetery, and Mrs. Crandall was more
lonely than ever.</p>

<p>One night there came a wagon to the door,
and Nellie Marshall, her face stained with tears,
alighted, with her three children. “We have
come to stay, mother,” said the broken-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
woman. “Byron has gone, nobody knows
where. He has used the money of others, and
we are penniless.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crandall wept on her daughter’s neck,
as she told somewhat of the hardships of her
life with her unfaithful and dishonest husband.</p>

<p>Other years passed, and another grave was
made beside that of Samuel Crandall, and Mrs.
Marshall, now grown white-haired, lived for her
three children, and reared them as best she
could in their poverty.</p>

<p>One day there was a rumor in the town that
John Harding was coming to Nineveh on a visit.
He was well-to-do now, and would come in a
style befitting his position. Mrs. Marshall wondered
if he would call upon her, and if he would
bring Mrs. Harding to see the woman so changed
from her girlhood in looks, but nobler and
sweeter in character.</p>

<p>Mr. Harding had been in Nineveh for a week.
Nellie Marshall had heard of it, and her heart
beat more quickly at any footstep on the
threshold. One moonlight night she could
not resist putting just one spray of golden
coreopsis in the buttonhole of her black dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
for if he should come that night he would like
to see it, perhaps; for, after all, women do not
forget any more than men.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock there was a knock at the
door; she was agitated. “Why should I
be? He is married,” she assured herself.</p>

<p>She opened the door, and John, grown
stouter in form and more attractive in face than
ever, stood before her. He met her cordially,
talked with the children, and seemed more joyous
than when a boy.</p>

<p>“And where is Mrs. Harding?” Nellie finally
found the courage to ask.</p>

<p>“She is not with me,” was the answer.</p>

<p>The call, really a long one, seemed short.</p>

<p>“When do you leave for the West, Mr.
Harding?” She had almost said “John,” for
she had thought of him all these years by the
old familiar name.</p>

<p>“Not for two or three weeks, and I shall see
you again.”</p>

<p>Day after day passed, and he did not come.
And now she realized, as she had never before,
that this was the only man she had ever loved;
that his presence made day, his absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
night; that she had loved him from childhood.
And now all was too late.</p>

<p>The time came for him to return to the West,
and once more he stood by the flower-beds
along the walk to the Nineveh house, this time
just as the sun was setting over the cedars. He
kissed the children. “I have none of my
own,” he said, and took Nellie’s hand, holding
it a little longer than he had held it before.
Her lips trembled, and her eyes must
have told all her heart.</p>

<p>“I have felt so deeply for you,” he said; and
his own voice grew tremulous. “And will you
let me leave this little remembrance for the
children?” He slipped a roll of bills into her
hand, and was gone in a moment.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and finally a letter came. She
knew the handwriting. What could John wish
of her? Perhaps he was inclined to adopt one
of her children, and, if so, which could she
spare?</p>

<p>Not the oldest boy, for he was her pride;
not the second, a girl, who was her comfort and
companion; not the youngest, for somehow he
looked like John, and he was dearer to her than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
all beside. When Byron was unkind her heart
always turned to John, and perchance stamped
her thoughts upon the open, frank face of her
youngest child.</p>

<p>She put the letter in her pocket; she must
be calm before she read it. She would go out
and sit by the mill where he and she sat
together. She opened it there and read:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><span class="smcap">My dear old-time Friend</span>: I am alone in the
world. I told you my wife was not with me. She died
some years ago. I wanted to see if you loved me, as I
believed you did. I hope and believe you do still. You
know me better than any one else, and you know whether
I should care tenderly for your children. If you are willing
to come and brighten my home, say so. How I
longed to fold you in my arms as I left you, but restrained
myself! Telegraph me if I shall come to take you.</p>

<p class="p1">A message was sent from Nineveh: “Come.”</p>

<p>The Crandall home has fallen like the others.
The flower-beds have vanished, save here and
there a self-sown golden coreopsis grows among
the weeds. The moon shines silently upon the
mill as of old. The few remaining aged people
of Nineveh still tell of the faithful love of John
Harding for the miller’s adopted daughter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE SECOND TIME.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">THE HON. John Crawford had become a
prominent man in his community. He
had begun life in poverty, had learned economy
early, and fortunately had married a girl
with tastes and habits similar to his own. Both
desired to rise in the world, and she, forgetting
herself, bent all her energies toward his progress
and success. She did her own housework
for years, made her own clothes and those
of her children, and in every way saved, that
John might be rich and influential. Her history
was like that of thousands of other New
England women&mdash;she wore herself out
for her family. She never had time for social
life, and not a very great amount of time for
reading, though she kept up as well as possible
with the thought of the day; but her one aim
was to have her husband honored.</p>

<p>John Crawford was a good husband, though
not always considerate. He thought nobody
quite so good and helpful as Betsey, nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
cooked so well, nobody was more saving, and
he was proud to rise by her help. He failed
sometimes to consider how large a matter that
help had been in his life. If he had been asked
who made his money he would have replied
without hesitation, “I made it.” That Betsey
was entitled to half, or even a third, would never
have occurred to him. He provided for her
and the children all they seemed to need. He
was the head of the family, and that headship
had made him somewhat selfish and domineering.</p>

<p>As the children grew older, and Mrs. Crawford
looked out into the future and realized the
possibility of leaving the world before her husband,
she thought much of their condition under
a changed home. Mr. Crawford would marry
again, probably, and her children might have
little or none of the property which they together
had struggled to earn.</p>

<p>One evening she said, as they sat before the
open fire, the children having gone to bed:
“John, it seems to me things are unequal in
the world. You and I have worked hard, and
I have been proud to have you succeed. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
both love the children, and want everything
done for them. What if I should die, and you
should marry again and have other children?”</p>

<p>“Why, Betsey! You don’t think I could
forget our own precious children? No second
wife could or would influence me against my
children. You and I have worked together,
and I should feel dishonorable to leave them
helpless and care for others. You must think
me a villain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, John! But I have seen cases like
that. Only the other day the Rev. Cornelius
Jones married a young wife, and gave her all
his property, leaving nothing to his three
daughters. Now, if a minister would do that,
what should we expect of others?”</p>

<p>“There must have been peculiar circumstances.
He could not have been in his right
mind.”</p>

<p>“You know, John, if you were to die I
should receive a third of what I have helped
you earn, and the rest would go to the
children; while if I were to die nothing would
go to the children. I should like to have at
least the third which the law considers mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
go to them at my death, as it does in some
countries of the Old World, where a man
cannot marry a second time till he has settled
a portion on his first children.”</p>

<p>“But that would be a great inconvenience,”
replied Mr. Crawford. “A man has money in
business, and to take out a third if his wife dies
might sadly embarrass him. Or even the use
of a third, set apart for them, might cripple
him.”</p>

<p>“Better that there be a little inconvenience
than a wrong done to children,” said Mrs.
Crawford. “The husband may lose every cent
of what the wife has struggled and saved all
her life to help him accumulate. Marriage is
a partnership, and, like other partnerships,
must suffer some change and inconvenience, it
may be, if one of the partners dies. There must,
necessarily, be a new adjustment of interests.”</p>

<p>“But the law allows you to make a will and
give away your property, my dear, just as it
does me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what I have inherited before or since
my marriage; but I have inherited none, and
you have not. We have made ours together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and you have often said that you owe as much
to my skill and economy as to your foresight
and ability.”</p>

<p>“And so I do, it is true; but the law makes
no provision about our common property.”</p>

<p>“But make it yourself then, John, if the law
does not. Make a will so that in case of my
death my two daughters shall have at least a
third of all you are worth at that time, or, if
you prefer, put a third&mdash;I might feel that it
ought to be half&mdash;in my name, or perhaps
the home, and let that go to our daughters.”</p>

<p>“But if I put the home in your name, so that
in case of losses something would be saved
from creditors, I should want it willed back to
me at your death, so that I could still have a
home and do as I liked with it.”</p>

<p>“And then nothing would go to the children
at my death? That is not fair, John, and I
have worked too hard and long to be willing.”</p>

<p>“Well, Betsey, you can trust me to do the
right thing. I will think it over,” and he kissed
her as they closed the not altogether satisfactory
conversation.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, Betsey Crawford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
broke down from the wear and tear of life,
and died, leaving her two daughters to the care
of a fond and not ungenerous father. The loss
was a great one to John Crawford. She had
been his competent adviser, with tact and good
sense to keep matters right. She had guided
more than he ever suspected. He mourned
her sincerely, as did her two devoted daughters.</p>

<p>He was lonely, and in time married again, a
woman considerably younger than himself, a
member of the same church, an ambitious and
not over-scrupulous woman. When her son
was born she became desirous that every advantage
should be placed before him, that he might
attain to wealth and honor. She convinced
Mr. Crawford in a thousand nameless ways
that the boy would need most of the property
for business, to marry well, and to carry down
the family name. The girls would doubtless
marry and be well provided for by their husbands.
She talked with Mr. Crawford about
the uncertainty of life, and, with tact, urged
that other things besides a spiritual preparation
for death were necessary. A man should think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the younger members of his family who
would be left comparatively helpless.</p>

<p>People said that the strong-willed John Crawford
had become very much under the sway of
his younger wife; that he had grown less dominant,
more appreciative, and more thoughtful
of her needs and wishes. He idolized his son,
but he seemed no dearer than the daughters of
Betsey. He was a more expensive child, for he
needed all sorts of playthings, the best schooling,
the best clothes, and a somewhat large
amount of spending money. It was evident that
John Crawford, Jr., would require more money
than his half-sisters.</p>

<p>In course of time, Mr. Crawford, having
served a term in Congress through good ability
and the discreet use of money in organizing
his forces, and having done well for his constituency,
followed Betsey to the other world.
To the surprise of all save the second Mrs.
Crawford the property was left to her and her
son, with the merest remembrance to the
unmarried daughters of hard-working Betsey
Crawford.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have thought it,” said a prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
lady in the church. “Why, John Crawford
was a deacon, and professed to live according
to right and justice! There must have been
undue influence. His first wife worked like a
slave to help earn that money. I never supposed
a man would be unfair to his children.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell what folks will do,” said
another church member. “Youth and tact are
great forces in the world. John Crawford never
meant to be unjust, but he couldn’t help it. A
third of that property ought to have gone to
those daughters. Why didn’t his wife make
him fix it before she died?”</p>

<p>“Maybe she tried, who knows?” said the
person addressed. “If the law didn’t make
him do his duty, how could you expect his
conscience to do it? We need some new
laws about the property which men and women
earn together.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crawford’s injustice resulted in the early
death of one daughter, and left bitter memories
of her father in the heart of the other.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">JASON and Eunice Kimball had always
longed for money. They had spent their
fifteen years of married life on a New England
farm, with all its cares and hardships, its early
rising, long hours of labor, and little compensation.</p>

<p>The white house, with its green blinds, roof
sloping to the rear, and great fir-trees in the
front yard, had grown dingy with dust and
rain, and there had been no money to repair
it.</p>

<p>The children, Susie, James, and little Jason,
fourteen, twelve, and ten years old, had worked
like their thrifty parents, gaining the somewhat
meagre schooling of a half-deserted New England
town.</p>

<p>Now a great change had come to the Kimball
family. A relative had died and had left
to Mrs. Kimball fifteen thousand dollars. It
seemed an enormous amount in one way, but
not enormous in another. The children must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
be better dressed and prepared for college, the
father must give up the slow gains of the farm
and go into business, and Mrs. Kimball must
make herself ready in garb and manner for the
new life. It was evident that they must move
to some village where schools were good and
business would be prosperous. What town
and what business? These were the exciting
topics that were discussed by night and by day.
Jason knew how to till the soil, to harvest
grain, to be an industrious and good citizen
and a kind husband, but he knew little about
the great world of trade.</p>

<p>“I might buy out a small grocery, Eunice,”
said the husband one evening. “People must
eat, whether they have decent clothes or books
or schools.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if you once looked at Mr. Jones’s
books and saw the uncollectible bills, even
from so-called ‘good families,’ you would not
undertake that business!”</p>

<p>“I might buy a tract of land in a growing
town and sell lots.”</p>

<p>“But what if a panic came, and you lost
all?” said the conservative wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as it became known that the Kimballs
had fallen heir to fifteen thousand dollars,
Mr. Kimball was besought on all sides to enter
one kind of business or another. One applicant
had invented a unique coffee-pot, which
would make good coffee out of even a poor
berry, and a fortune could certainly be made,
if only capital were provided. Another person
had a new style of wash-boiler, and experimented
with it on Mrs. Kimball’s kitchen stove,
breaking every lid in the operation. Fortunes
seemed lying about at every corner of the
street, and the only wonder was that everybody
did not get rich. Mr. Kimball was besought
to take out life insurance, to buy acres of land
in the far West, unseen by buyer or seller, to
give to every charity within the State, where-ever
the knowledge of the fifteen-thousand-dollar
inheritance had permeated.</p>

<p>Finally the town for a home was decided
upon, and the business&mdash;that of selling coal.</p>

<p>A pretty house was purchased, his children
placed in school, a seat in church rented, and a
shop for the sale of hard and soft coal.</p>

<p>Mr. Kimball knew nothing of the coal business;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
but he formed a partnership with a man
who knew everything about it&mdash;in fact, too
much, for at the end of a year the firm failed,
the five thousand dollars that Mrs. Kimball gave
to her husband having melted away like snow
in spring.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kimball’s patience had not increased
with her gift of money. She blamed her husband
for losing, blamed herself for giving the
money to him, blamed the world in general.</p>

<p>Mr. Kimball tried other matters, and failed.
It was difficult to find a situation in which to
work for others, as he was of middle age and
young men were preferred. He tried life insurance,
and either lacked the courage to visit
people in season and out of season, or he lacked
volume of speech or multiplicity of argument.</p>

<p>It became evident to the neighbors and to
the minister of the parish that matters were
going wrong in the Kimball home. The husband
wished to go into business again; the
wife felt sure that he would lose, and nothing
would be left for the children. They reasoned,
they quarrelled, and Mrs. Kimball became ill
from anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>At last it was noised about that a separation
might come in the divided family. Friends
interposed, but nothing satisfactory was accomplished.
The few thousands that remained were
safe in the bank; and this amount Mrs. Kimball
had decided should not be touched.</p>

<p>One morning the little village was thrown into
consternation. The bank had lost all its funds
through the speculation of one of its officers.
Save for the little home, the Kimballs were
penniless.</p>

<p>Sorrow is sometimes a great strengthener.
Mrs. Kimball rose from her illness to face the
problems of life. Both parents loved their
children, and they were too young to be thrown
upon the world.</p>

<p>“Let us sell our home,” said Mrs. Kimball,
“buy back the old farm, and live together till
the end.”</p>

<p>And Jason said, “Yes, wife, we shall be
happier in the old place without the fifteen
thousand dollars.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE RING OF GOLD.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap05 p2">MARTIN DALY had become discouraged.
Like many another miner in the far
West, he had made money and lost it, had
prospected for mines, found ore, and been
cheated out of his rights, had grown poor and
ill, and had thrown himself under a tree, careless
whether he lived or died.</p>

<p>The great snowy mountain-peaks and the
rich verdure had lost their attraction for him.
He had hoped and been disappointed so many
times that he had come to believe himself unlucky;
that he should never possess a dollar;
that there was neither happiness nor home for
him.</p>

<p>He had seen more prosperous days. His
large dark eyes, his broad brow, his well-shaped
mouth and chin, bespoke refinement in the
years that were gone. He had been well educated,
had tried many things and failed in them,
not from lack of energy nor from lack of judgment,
but his fate seemed to be an adverse one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>He had done many good acts, had always
helped his brother miners, had tried to look on
the bright side of life, had fought manfully, and
been defeated in the battle. He had imagined
sometimes that the clouds had a silver lining,
but the storms always came sooner or later.
He meditated thus as he lay under the tree,
and finally, more dead than alive from want and
exhaustion, fell asleep.</p>

<p>Two men passed along under the brow of
the mountain, by the tree. They were tall and
straight, and from their dark hair and skin it
was easy to perceive their Indian blood.</p>

<p>“The white man is dead,” said one of the
men, as he bent on his knee beside the sleeper.</p>

<p>“No, there is a twitching of the eyelids,”
said the other. “He is pale and sick. I will
take him home, and Mimosa will care for him.”</p>

<p>The conversation, carried on in a low tone,
awakened the miner.</p>

<p>“Come with us, and you shall have food and
shelter,” said the friendly Indian.</p>

<p>Scarcely able to bear his weight, Martin
leaned upon the arms of the two men, and soon
found himself in the humble Indian cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mimosa, here is a stranger. Take care of
him. Red Cloud never left a human being to
die. He will get well, and then we will send
him back to his people.”</p>

<p>A shy, pale Indian girl came forward and did
as she was bidden. She did not speak, but
looked very pityingly out of her fawn-like dark
eyes. When Martin had been placed in the
simple bed she prepared food for him, and fed
him as though he were a child. Day by day
she came and went, speaking little, but doing
gently the things which only a woman’s hands
can do.</p>

<p>After a time the miner, still a young man,
gained in strength, and began once more to
hope for a successful future.</p>

<p>“Mimosa,” he said one day, “I owe my life
to you, and if I am ever rich I will come back
and reward you.”</p>

<p>“I shall miss you,” said the girl shyly. “But
I want no money. I shall be happy because
you are well again and happy.”</p>

<p>“I shall yet find gold, Mimosa. I used to
think I should be rich, and then I became poor
and sick and lost heart. You wear a ring on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
your finger and sometimes a chain about your
neck, both of beaten gold. Did the metal come
from mines near here?”</p>

<p>“My father gave them to me,” she replied,
and nothing more could be learned from her
on the subject.</p>

<p>“Would you care, Mimosa, if I wore the
ring until I went away? Perhaps I can find
the place where the gold came from.”</p>

<p>“You may wear it till you come back rich,”
she said, smiling.</p>

<p>Days grew into weeks, and the time drew
near for the miner to say good-by to the girl
who had become his comrade as well as deliverer.
Tears filled her eyes as they parted.
“You will forget Mimosa,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, I will bring back the ring, and you
shall give it to the man who makes you his
bride. I shall never forget Red Cloud nor his
daughter.”</p>

<p>Strong and hopeful again, Martin took up
life, obtained work, and believed once more
that he should find gold.</p>

<p>But he missed the Indian girl. The pines on
the snowy mountain-peaks whispered of her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The evenings seemed longer than formerly;
the conversation of the miners less interesting.
He was lonely. He was earning a fair living,
but of what use was money to him if he was
to feel desolate in heart? Mimosa was not of
his race, but she had a lovable nature. He
remembered that she looked sad at his going
away. He wondered if she ever thought about
him. If she had some Indian suitor, would she
not wish for the ring again? He would like at
least to see the man and his daughter who had
saved his life. He would carry back the ring.
Ah! if he knew where the gold in it came
from, perhaps he would indeed become rich,
and then who could make him so happy as
Mimosa?</p>

<p>Months only increased the loneliness in
Martin’s heart. He was becoming discouraged
again. He even began to fear that Mimosa
was married, and his soul awakened to a sense
of loss. He would go back just once and see
her, and on his journey back he would sit for a
half-hour under the tree where Red Cloud had
found him.</p>

<p>“What ails Martin?” said one miner to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
another. “He must be in love&mdash;no fun in
him as in the old days. Going to quit camp,
he says.”</p>

<p>After Martin had decided to go to see Red
Cloud his heart seemed lighter. If Mimosa
were married he could at least show her his
gratitude. And if she were not? Well, it
would be very restful to see her once more!</p>

<p>He started on his journey. The full moon
was rising as he neared the old tree where Red
Cloud had found him. As he approached he
was startled by a white figure. He turned aside
for a moment, and then went cautiously up to
the great trunk. Two dark eyes full of tears
gazed up into his eyes, at first with a startled
look and then with a gleam of joy and trust.</p>

<p>“Mimosa!” he exclaimed, and clasped the
Indian girl in his arms. “Why are you here,
child, at this time of night?”</p>

<p>“I came here to think of you, Martin, and
the moonlight is so sweet and comforting. The
green trees and the mountains tell me of you.”</p>

<p>“I have brought you back the ring, Mimosa.”</p>

<p>“And are you rich yet? You were to keep
it till you were rich.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but I would be rich, perhaps, if you
would tell me where the gold in the ring was
found.”</p>

<p>“My father gave it to me,” she replied
quietly.</p>

<p>“Mimosa, would you love me if I were rich?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should be afraid of you if you
were.”</p>

<p>“Would you love me if I remained poor as I
am now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, always.”</p>

<p>“And if I became sick and could not care
for you, what then?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> would care for <i>you</i>, Martin.”</p>

<p>“I have brought back the ring, Mimosa, that
you may give it to the man who shall make you
his bride.”</p>

<p>“And would you like to keep the ring yourself,
Martin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest.”</p>

<p>They went back to the home of Red Cloud,
happy because promised to each other in marriage.</p>

<p>After a quiet wedding Mimosa said one day:
“Come with me, Martin, and I will show you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
where the gold in the ring and the necklace
were found.”</p>

<p>Not very far from the tree where the miner
had lain down discouraged Mimosa pointed out
the shining ore, the spot known only to the few
Indians.</p>

<p>“Mimosa, there is a mine here! This gold
is the outcropping of the veins. I shall yet be
rich, my darling.”</p>

<p>“Would you surely love me as much, Martin,
if you were rich?”</p>

<p>“I would give you everything your heart
desired.”</p>

<p>“And not go to an Eastern country, and be
great, and forget Mimosa?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>With a happy heart Martin Daly took his
pick to the mountains. The golden ore opened
under his touch. His claim each day showed
more value. He had, indeed, become rich
through the ring of Mimosa.</p>

<p>Times have changed. The children of the
Indian girl, educated, gentle as their mother
and energetic as their father, are in a handsome
house. Love in the home has kept as bright as
the gold in the mountain.</p>

<h2 class="p4">FOUR LETTERS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap06 p2">DEAR ERNEST: I am sitting under a
great oak this summer afternoon, just as
the sun is setting. The western sky is crossed
with bands of brilliant red and yellow, while
overhead, and to the east, pink fleecy clouds
are floating like phantom ships of coral. The
green forest of beech and oak at my right mellows
in the deepening gray of the twilight, and
the white mansion at my left, with its red roof,
looks like some castle in a story. The grand
blue lake in the distance seems closer to me in
the subdued light, and I almost question if this
be a picture or reality.</p>

<p>How I wish you were here to sit beside me,
and talk as we used to do in college days!
Then we wondered where each would be, what
experiences would fill each heart, and what the
future had for us in its shadowy keeping.</p>

<p>You have been a wanderer, and seen much of
the world. I have had, for the most part, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
quiet life of study, have finished a book, have
had anxieties, as who has not, but, best of all, I
have found my ideal.</p>

<p>You will perhaps smile at this, and recall to
me my love of athletic sports, my disregard of
the affections, my entire ability to live without
the gentler sex. Not that you and I both did
not admire a brilliant eye, or a rosy lip, or a
perfect hand, but life was so full without all
this that we looked at women as one does at
rare pictures&mdash;expensive luxuries, to be admired
rather than possessed.</p>

<p>But all has changed with me. I have met
one who will, I think, fill my vision for life.
She is not strictly beautiful. Her blue eyes are
calm and clear. Her manner is not responsive,
and she would seem to a stranger like one to
be worshipped from afar. She has depth of
affection, but it is not on the surface.</p>

<p>Edith Graham is to most persons a mystery.
She loves nature, sits with me often to enjoy
these wonderful sunsets, makes me feel that I
am in the presence of a goddess, and goes her
way, while I continue to worship her.</p>

<p>Yes, I think I have used the right word&mdash;“worship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>”
I walk a thousand times past the house
where she lives because she is there. I linger
in the pathways where she daily walks, with the
feeling that her footsteps have given them a
special sacredness. I know well the seat in the
forest near here where she comes to read and
look upon the distant lake. Every friend of
hers is nearer to me because her friend. The
graves, even, of her dear ones are precious to
me. Every tree or flower she has admired is
fairer to me. The golden-rod of the fields I
keep ever in my study because she loves and
gathers it. I have planted red carnations in
my garden because she delights to wear them.
The autumn leaves are exquisite to me because
she paints them, and I recall the sound of her
feet among the rustling leaves with the same
joy which I feel in remembering the music
of the priests of Notre Dame, or the voices
of the nuns of the Sacré Cœur in Rome, at
sunset.</p>

<p>The moon, from new to full, has an added
beauty because when Edith and I are separated
she speaks to us both the eternal language
of love. When I watch the clouds break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
over her majestic face I know that Edith too
enjoys the beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>The song of the robins among our trees is
sweeter because Edith hears it. The little
stream that wanders near us and glides over
the stones at the foot of the hill in a white
sheet of spray is a bond between us, for we
have both looked upon it. Edith’s name
seems as musical to me as the waterfall. I can
fancy that it is graven upon my heart.</p>

<p>I know every change of her features,&mdash;she is
almost always quiet,&mdash;and her every word and
act I have gone over and over in my mind ten
thousand times. We have read together, and
I hope she loves me. This companionship is
so blessed that I dread to speak to her of love&mdash;though
my face must always tell it&mdash;lest,
possibly, the dream be dispelled, and I wake
to the dreadful knowledge that she cannot be
mine.</p>

<p>Do you know all these feelings, Ernest?
Whatever you may think of me, I have grown
a nobler man through them. All womanhood
is more sacred to me. I can do work I never
thought myself capable of before. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
be a pleasure to work for Edith as long as I
live. I am going to Europe soon, and I must
settle this matter. I will write you then.</p>

<p class="pr8">Yours,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<hr class="d2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ernest</span>: The scene has changed
since I wrote you months ago. I am at the
foot of the Jungfrau, whose snowy top, gilded
by the sun, is ever a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>The day I dreaded has come and gone. I
have told Edith all my heart, and, alas! she is
not mine. She was already half plighted to
a young naval officer, whom she met when she
was away at school. I believe she was fond of
me, for our tastes are similar, but she has been
the true woman through it all.</p>

<p>I blame her? Never! I would not allow my
heart to cherish such a thought for a moment.</p>

<p>Do I love her less? No. Shall I think a
flower less beautiful and fragrant because another
owns it and enjoys it? Edith will be to
me ever the same lovely picture of youthful
womanhood&mdash;the same blessing, though to me
unattainable. Do not imagine that I shall forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
her. A man loves as deeply as a woman,
often more deeply, and not seldom remembers
as long as she does. Other faces may interest
me; other women be companionable; but they
will not be Edith.</p>

<p>I shall go back to our old home beside the
lake, because she will sometime come there,
and it will always be a comfort and pleasure
to see her, even if she does not see me. Perhaps
it is a foolish wish, but I shall hope sometime
to rest in the same cemetery where she
rests.</p>

<p>I love to think of her the last thing as I
sleep, for then ofttimes in my dreams she talks
and walks with me, and I awake refreshed by
the memory.</p>

<p>Some one has said, “Happiness is not possession.
It is giving and growing;” and I
know that I am growing more fit for her
companionship, even though it come only in
another life.</p>

<p>The seas she sails upon, the harbors she
enters, will all be nearer and dearer to me.
The world will grow larger instead of smaller to
my vision. I shall be lonely; yes, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
unbearably lonely. But, after all, what a blessing
to have known her&mdash;to have loved her&mdash;to
have offered her the best thing a man can offer
a woman, the consecration of his life to her!
What if I had gone through these years and
not have seen such an ideal? How poor would
be my heart! Now I can say with Shelley,
“Love’s very pain is sweet.”</p>

<p>Of course I can but think of what I have
missed. To have seen her in a pleasant home
and to come to her after the day’s work was
done would have been bliss indeed. To have
seen the sun set and the moon rise; to have
walked over the hills and meadows together; to
have read by our open fire; to have laughed
and wept and prayed and grown gray-haired
together&mdash;all this would have made life complete.
Even silence together would have made
earth seem heaven.</p>

<p>Life is indeed a mystery. It brings us development,
if not happiness. For a time after I
left home I seemed unable to put myself to any
labor, but I have come to be grateful that for
me there is so beautiful an ideal&mdash;one that
sheds a halo about even the saddest day. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
there come times of anguish, when I long to
hold Edith’s hand in mine; to press her to my
heart with all the rapture of a perfect love.
Then I go out under the blue sky and walk,
if I can, always towards the sunset, getting out
of the rich color all the balm possible for an
unsatisfied soul.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if she realizes how I
worship her&mdash;if she knows all the bliss of loving,
and the eternal sorrow of losing. Ah! I
know it all.</p>

<p class="pr8">Yours always,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<hr class="d2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ernest</span>: How the years have come
and gone since I wrote you from Switzerland!
I have just seen Edith home from a voyage to
Japan. And she has brought her little girl of
three, with her own blue eyes and the same
reserved, quiet ways. The child came across
the hill with her nurse to our grove, and I
made friends with her and held her on my knee
and kissed her. She could not know how very
dear she is to me, and why. She could not
guess that the golden hair which I fondled took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
me back to other days, and quickened the flow
of blood in my veins. Her smooth, fair skin is
like her mother’s. I could not help wishing
that she might stay with me forever, and look
out upon the lake and the sunsets.</p>

<p>It will be a dreadful wrench to my heart
when they go back. Japan is so far away.
Edith looks paler than formerly, and smiles
less frequently. I have heard it hinted that
she is not happy. Can it be possible that her
husband does not appreciate the treasure which
he has won?</p>

<p>If I could only speak a word of comfort to
her&mdash;but that cannot be. She is very pleasant,
but calm, with me, and seems glad to have me
love her little daughter. I thought I saw tears
in her eyes as we sat with the child between us
under the oak last night at sunset, but she rose
hastily, and said she should take cold in the
falling dew.</p>

<p>She is more beautiful to me than when a girl.
Her face has more of thought and feeling in
it, and a trace of suffering as well, and that
heightens her beauty to me, and to men generally,
I think. We love to care for others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
especially if they need our care, if there is any
manhood in us.</p>

<p>Ah, there is nothing on earth so interesting
as a woman, with her tenderness, her solicitude
for our welfare, her quiet reserve, her gentle
listening, her brightness, her nobleness, her
grace!</p>

<p>After Edith left me, taking her little girl by
the hand, I confess I was desolate, overwhelmingly
desolate. Why is it that one person can
make night seem day to us; can bring perfect
rest and content? I should not have cared if
years could have passed while we sat there together.
She will go away soon, and I shall
have to fight the old battle with self over again,
and conquer, and go back to daily duties.</p>

<p>Come and see me here at this lovely outlook.
I will show you her child’s picture&mdash;so like
the mother. What will the end be? I suppose
you ask. The same as now, probably. I do
not look for anything different. I try to be
happy and thankful that I live in the same
world and now and then in the same city with
Edith.</p>

<p class="pr8">Faithfully,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<hr class="d2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ernest</span>: You and I are growing older,
but we have kept the same true friendship
through all the years. Your life has been full
of love and sunshine, and mine so desolate,
except for one ennobling affection.</p>

<p>But a great change has come into my life.
Edith has come back with her daughter, and
both are in mourning. They have been here
for months, but I have seen little of them.</p>

<p>A few evenings ago I sat with them among
the trees surrounding their lovely home, and
as I left I dared to tell Edith that I had not
buried all hope for the future. She looked at
me gravely, I thought with an appealing expression
in her blue eyes, as though she longed
for a place where her heart might rest. You
know how the eyes can speak volumes. I had
never seen her look thus before. Every woman
loves to be worshipped. “She must at least
be gratified that I love her,” I said to myself.</p>

<p class="ls1">••••••••</p>

<p>I have been to see Edith this evening at sunset.
She and I have walked in the ravines,
and I have pushed away the underbrush from
her lovely head, and told her that I longed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
care for her always, and she has laid her white
hand on my arm and said, “I love you.”</p>

<p>I scarcely know what I am writing. To
have her and her child in my home forever!
To have the peace and satisfaction and rest of
a reciprocal affection! To have her mine to
kiss and be proud of, and to live for! To
gather golden-rod and carnations for her as
when she was a girl! To see the curling smoke
of ships on the blue lake, and the golden sunsets,
and the rich autumn coloring together, and
to know that we shall live side by side till death
parts us, and then shall rest together under the
same myrtles and red berries of the mountain
ash in the cemetery!</p>

<p>Life has begun anew. I seem almost a boy
again, while Edith is sweet and grave and
happy. I sometimes half fear that it is a
dream, it is all so beautiful. The world never
seemed half so attractive as now. Come and
see us in our home.</p>

<p class="pr8">Ever yours,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">REWARDED.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">THE SNOW was falling on Christmas eve in
the little village of West Beverly. A
good many young people were disappointed as
they watched the feathery crystals come floating
down from a sky that seemed full of snowbanks.
They wished to go to a party, or
concert, or home gathering, and who could tell
whether Christmas would be stormy and disagreeable?</p>

<p>Widow Wadsworth sat in her plain home
with her four children, whose faces were
pressed against the window pane, guessing
what the coming day would bring. Not
presents, no; the Wadsworths were too poor
for those. But if the day were sunny the
sleigh bells would ring, and the poor could
slide and make merry as well as the rich.</p>

<p>Hugh, a bright boy of sixteen, had finished
his education. By hard work his mother had
helped him through the High School, and now
he was ready to do his part in the world’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
work. Not that he did not long for college.
Other boys had gone out from West Beverly
across the hills to Amherst and to Harvard,
but they had fathers to assist them, or kind
friends who had furnished the money. Hugh
must now aid in the support of his two sisters
and little brother.</p>

<p>He had earned something by working Saturdays,
so that when Christmas morning dawned
Kate Wadsworth found some plaid for a new
dress outside her door, Jenny a doll, and Willie
a sled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wadsworth’s eyes filled with tears as
she kissed Hugh. “It will all come right in
the end,” she said. “I wish you could go to
college, but many a man succeeds without it,
and educates himself. It is blessed that we are
alive and well, and are able to work. There is
as much room in the world for my children as
for anybody’s. You have been a noble son,
and we all love you. I wanted to buy you
something, but the money had to go for rent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, mother! I don’t need
anything. I’m going over to Mr. Carter’s to
see if they want the snow shovelled from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
walks. Tell Willie to come over with his new
sled and see me work.” And Hugh’s big blue
eyes brightened as he stepped out into the
frosty air. Blessed hope of youth, that carries
us into the realities of middle life stronger and
happier for the burdens that must be borne!</p>

<p>The Carter mansion away on the hills belonged
to the Hon. William Carter, owner of
the woollen mills. A man of kind heart, good
to his employees, he had always felt an interest
in Hugh because the father had worked in his
mills. This Christmas morning the Carters
wished several walks cleared. The hired man
could have done it, but Mr. Carter preferred
that Hugh should have the work.</p>

<p>The owner of the woollen mills watched the
boy from the window as he shovelled. “A
very promising lad,” he said to his wife, a little
lady much younger than himself. “I wonder
what he intends to do in the world,” and putting
his hands in his pockets he walked up and
down the floor. “Jerome Wadsworth was a
good workman in the mills. I guess the widow
has had a hard time of it since he died.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter walked towards the dining-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
where the breakfast dishes were being removed
from the table.</p>

<p>“Margaret, when the boy has finished clearing
the walks, send him to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” responded the maid.</p>

<p>An hour later, his cheeks aglow from labor,
Hugh stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Come in, Hugh, and sit down. What are
you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I am ready for any honest work, Mr. Carter.
I wanted to go to college, but that is out
of the question.”</p>

<p>“How much would it cost you?”</p>

<p>“From five to six hundred dollars a year, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Would your mother like to have you go?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed. She has always
wanted it, but I think she really needs my
wages now to help her.”</p>

<p>“But you can help her better after you have
an education. You could earn more, and you
would be an honor to her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know of nothing that would make
her so happy.”</p>

<p>“Well, my son is young yet, and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
may happen which will prevent my sending
James to college, so I will send you while I
can.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s blue eyes grew moist. He was indeed
to have a Christmas present: a four
years’ course at college.</p>

<p>“I will come over and talk with your mother
about it,” said Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>Hugh hurried home, and entered the cottage
quite out of breath. Calling his mother aside,
he whispered, “Mother, I have a secret to tell
you. Mr. Carter is going to send me to college,
and then I can better help you and the
rest. Just think of it&mdash;to have it happen on
Christmas Day! And I never expected it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wadsworth could not speak as she
folded her boy in her arms and kissed him.
What did it matter to her self-sacrificing heart
whether she worked early and late, if Hugh
could only be educated! True, he would no
longer share her humble cottage, and she
would miss his help and companionship, but her
life was nothing&mdash;his was all. If anything in
humanity touches divinity, it is motherhood, that
loves and sacrifices without hope of reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Busy days followed, when the little trunk was
packed, prayers offered, the good-bys said, and
her boy Hugh went out into the world.</p>

<p>Four years passed&mdash;four years with their
new friendships, eager plans, broader outlook,
and development of character.</p>

<p>Meantime Widow Wadsworth struggled on,
Mr. Carter helping the family somewhat, so
that the sisters eventually could fit themselves
for teaching. When college days were over
another time of anxiety came. Should Hugh
have a profession or go into business? He
loved books, and finally, after much consideration,
he decided to enter the law, working his
way as best he could by teaching and writing.
Steadily he won success, and before thirty was
on the road to fame and fortune.</p>

<p>The years had whitened Widow Wadsworth’s
hair. All her family were now earning, and
life had become easier. The years, too, had
brought changes in the Carter family. The
woollen mills had failed to bring money to their
owner, and the large home had passed into
other hands. Pretty Isabel Carter, whom it
was whispered Hugh had desired to marry, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thrown herself away on a showy youth, who
married her with the expectation of securing a
fortune. James Carter, the only son, was working
his way through college.</p>

<p>As is often the case, a woman was longing
and praying for James’s success. Jenny Wadsworth
was teaching a village school. She and
James Carter had been friends. She knew his
many good qualities, and whether he ever cared
for her or not she determined that his father’s
failure should not spoil his life if she could help
it. Kate could assist the family, and unbeknown
to any one Jenny was saving money for
James Carter’s education. One morning a
letter was sent to Hugh, saying: “James Carter
is trying to work his way through college, and
we must help him. Here is one hundred dollars
which I have saved, and I will send more
soon. Do not tell anybody living, but use it
for him. Mr. Carter helped you, and I know
you will be only too glad to help James. I see
him rarely, but he is a noble fellow, and I long
to have him succeed. In a little while he can
be in the office with you. Your loving sister,
Jenny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh smiled as he read the letter, and
blessed woman for her sweet self-sacrifice;
but a shadow came over his face in a moment.
Perhaps he thought of Isabel, and of his own
disappointment.</p>

<p>A letter was sent to James the next morning
with a check from Hugh and a hundred dollars
from “a friend.” “Come to me,” wrote Hugh,
“as soon as you are through college, and let
me help to repay a little of the debt I shall
always owe your father.”</p>

<p>When his course was finished James Carter,
manly in physique and refined in face, stood in
the doorway of a New York office. He was
warmly welcomed by Hugh, who had not seen
him for years.</p>

<p>“The debt is more than paid to my father,”
said James. “I have had your example always
before me to surmount obstacles and make a
man of myself, and now in turn I hope to help
you by faithful labor. I have been curious to
learn of the ‘friend’ who has sent me money.
I have thought over all my father’s acquaintances
and cannot decide who it can be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, James; you will learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sometime perhaps, and it is of no consequence
if you do not! The act of giving is what
broadens hearts, whether the giver ever be
known or not. I promised to keep it a secret.”</p>

<p>The two young men went to live in quiet
bachelor quarters together. Work, earnest and
absorbing, filled the days and often the evenings.</p>

<p>“I have asked mother and Jenny to spend a
few days with us,” said Hugh one evening.
“Jenny teaches in a town not far from here,
and my good mother has been visiting her, and
will stay here a little on her way to West
Beverly.”</p>

<p>“That will do us good. I have had so little
time to see ladies that it will seem quite a home
touch to our bachelor life,” responded James.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wadsworth and her daughter came, and
a week passed happily. Jenny was intelligent
and charming&mdash;how could she be other than
lovely with such a mother? The four walked
in the evenings, Jenny seeming naturally to be
left in the care of James, while Hugh delighted
in showing attention to his mother. When
mother and daughter had gone home the quiet
room seemed desolate. Hugh missed them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but James was absolutely homesick. New
York, great and fascinating, had lost its attraction.
With the departure of one face the sun
seemed to fade out of the sky.</p>

<p>“You seem sad, James,” said Hugh, as they
sat together one evening,&mdash;he wondered if
Jenny’s visit did not have something to do with
it,&mdash;“and perhaps you better take a few days’
vacation and go home.”</p>

<p>“I am restless and unhappy; I scarcely
know why. I think a change would do me
good.”</p>

<p>James started the next day for West Beverly,
but easily persuaded himself that a call on
Jenny Wadsworth at the place where she was
teaching, if only for a few hours, would make
the journey pleasanter. As he surmised, he
felt lighter-hearted after his visit with her,
especially as he obtained from her a promise
that she would correspond with him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, who idolized her son, was made
very happy by his coming. When he returned
to the city, work seemed less irksome, letters
grew singularly interesting and comforting, till
one day James said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hugh, there’s no use in trying to hide from
you the fact that I love your sister Jenny, and
wish to marry her as soon as I can support
her.”</p>

<p>“She loved you long ago, James, but I
was not allowed to tell you of it. Are you
engaged?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve found out who the ‘friend’ is,
then?”</p>

<p>James Carter turned pale.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that Jenny earned money
to help take me through college?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I will pay her back compound interest,
the noble girl.”</p>

<p>Years have passed. Hugh, now very wealthy,
has never married, but finds a happy home with
James and Jenny Carter and their little son
Hugh. The Hon. William Carter learned that
it pays a thousand-fold to help a boy on in the
world, and Jenny rejoices that she, too, helped
a young man to success.</p>

<h2>THE UNOPENED LETTER.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">THERE was a carriage waiting at the door,
and the servant had just announced to
Miss Hamilton that a gentleman had called to
see her.</p>

<p>“I will be down in a moment,” answered a
cheery, blue-eyed girl, as she slipped an unopened
letter into her pocket. She had recognized
the handwriting as the postman handed it
to her. The letter was from a young college
senior in the quiet New England town, at home
for his summer vacation,&mdash;Arthur Ellsworth,
a manly fellow, whom she had known and
admired from childhood. And now Arthur’s
brother, Elmer Ellsworth, was waiting to take
her for a drive. The latter was the handsomer
of the two possibly, with his fine form and dark
eyes. He, also, was in the last year of college
life.</p>

<p>After pleasant greetings the young people
started, in the bright September morning, for
the proposed ride. Who that has driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
through Lexington and Woburn, past Mystic
pond, will ever forget the quiet country roads,
the historic associations, the variety of wooded
hills and pretty valleys? Now the two schoolfriends
talked of the present with its joy and
the future with its hopes, of the books they had
studied and the plans they had made. Now
they gathered golden-rod, and listened to the
song of the birds in the bracing air. It was a
fitting time to say what had long been in
Elmer’s heart&mdash;that sometime, when his profession
had been entered upon, she would be
the woman whom he wished to make his wife.</p>

<p>It was a hard matter for her to decide. Both
brothers had been dear to her, perhaps Arthur
especially,&mdash;and both were noble and worthy.
Arthur had never spoken to her of marriage;
and now Elmer had told her his love, and that
she could make him happy. Had Arthur
spoken first, perhaps her heart would have
more warmly responded; but in the beauty of
that autumn morning, with the hopeful, earnest
young man by her side, she gave her promise
to be his wife.</p>

<p>As soon as she reached her home she ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
upstairs, hastily threw off her wraps, and
remembered the letter from Arthur, in her
pocket. Opening it, she read:</p>

<p>“How many times I have wanted to tell you
that I loved you! How often have the words
died on my lips! But now, before I go back
to college, I must ask you if you can return
that love, and sometime be mine.”</p>

<p>Alas, that she had not opened the letter
sooner! She could not tell Arthur that she
had preferred him to Elmer; that were disloyalty
to the man whom she had promised to
wed. She could only say that she was already
betrothed to his brother. She married him
whom she had promised. Both men became
prominent in the history of New England&mdash;this
little story is true. One went through life
unmarried. His letter was opened too late.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">THREE COLLEGE STUDENTS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap03 p2">“WHAT’S the work for vacation, boys?”</p>

<p>The speaker was a tall, dark-haired,
open-faced young man, who sat with his two
companions on the sloping ground of Amherst
College, looking away to silent Mount Tom
and the fertile meadows of the Connecticut-river
valley.</p>

<p>“It’s something downright earnest for me,”
said James Wellman, a broad-shouldered, big-hearted
youth from the neighboring county,
who in spite of poverty and many obstacles
had fought his way by the hardest work.
“I’m in debt for board, books unpaid for; but
I’ve seen worse times than these. I’m used to
standing alone, so I’m ready for the battle. I
shall take an agency&mdash;books, or maybe clothes-wringers,
to sell.”</p>

<p>“That will be fun, I’ll warrant,” said the first
speaker, Grant Reynolds, whose father, a rich
manufacturer, had spared no pains to make his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
son’s life a bed of roses, altogether different
from what his own had been.</p>

<p>“Not much fun,” said James. “You wouldn’t
like contemptuous looks from women who know
less than you, and whose hearts had become
hardened because their husbands, once poor,
very likely, had become the possessors of houses
on aristocratic streets. Why, a woman&mdash;I will
not call her a lady&mdash;whose husband used to be
a stable boy, but who has become a rich government
official, ordered me out of the house
when I was selling chromos. She said ‘agents
were tramps and a nuisance;’ and when I explained
that I was working my way through
college, she answered, remembering the former
occupation of her lord, perhaps, ‘Be somebody’s
coachman, then, and earn an honorable
living.’ I wanted to add, ‘And run away with
your pretty daughter;’ but I only replied
politely, ‘Nobody would hire an inexperienced
man for two months, which is as long as our
vacation lasts.’”</p>

<p>“But these must be rare cases,” said Grant.
“Most well-to-do ladies are very courteous.”</p>

<p>“Yes, when you meet them on an equality in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
drawing-rooms; but not always when you are a
workingman.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try it for once. It’ll be a fine
lark anyway, and I shall learn something of
human nature.”</p>

<p>“That you will,” answered Wellman. “I’ll
take the country round that aristocratic town
down the river, and you may take the stylish
avenues. You’ll find blue blood in plenty&mdash;blue
because the fathers owned land there a
little before the present generation. Of course,
you’ll find many well-bred people who are
proud of their heads rather than of their purses;
but even these are often very ‘select.’ We
profess equality, and are probably more democratic
than any other country; but a little extra
amount of front lawn, or the fact that our great-grandfather
was a governor, or that one woman
has ‘William Morris’ chintz in her chambers,
of which, perhaps, her neighbor never heard,&mdash;these
make various degrees of rank. If our
ancestor came over in the ‘Mayflower,’ or was
even a sutler in the Revolutionary war, our
fame is unalterably fixed.”</p>

<p>“I should like to sell books in so high-toned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a town,” said Grant. “Maybe I might fall in
love with some dainty daughter of a lineal descendant
of a governor, or of a stable-boy!”</p>

<p>“Precious little good it would do a book-agent,
for you would be classed among poor
people if you worked, no matter how rich your
father might be.”</p>

<p>The conversation had been listened to by a
light-haired, blue-eyed student, a poet in temperament
and by heredity. He was the only
child of a devoted minister of the Gospel, now
dead, and of a refined and intellectual mother.
She would have shielded him from every rough
wind had it been possible, but at best she could
only pray for him, and send him now and then
a little box of comforts, with her fond and
beautiful letters. He worked late at night over
his books, and his delicately curved mouth had
come to bear an expression of sadness as he
looked out upon the struggle before him.
Heretofore the little money of the household
had sufficed; but now he must earn his bread
like James Wellman.</p>

<p>“Cheer up!” said the latter, who had noticed
the tell-tale face of the minister’s son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Kent Raymond. “Blue eyes and polished
manners will win kindness. We all have to get
a trifle mellowed. We, who know how to earn
our support, get a little extra schooling more
than the other boys, that’s all. Life is good or
bad, just as you look out upon it. It’s full
of sunshine to me, for I won’t look at the
shadows.”</p>

<p>Vacation days came. Kent and Grant took
the book-agency, and James the clothes-wringer,
among the country folk, who usually have a
kindly interest in a boy who means to be somebody
in the world.</p>

<p class="ls1">••••••••</p>

<p>One bright day soon after, satchels in hand,
the two college boys started out along one of
the broad avenues of the staid old city.</p>

<p>“Don’t get discouraged!” said Grant to his
boyish companion, who shrank from his task.
“Remember you’re doing missionary work
every time you get a book into a house. We’ll
report three hours from now at the end of the
street.”</p>

<p>The first house was of gray stone, set back in
the grounds; not belonging to one of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
families, who prefer an old mansion, lest they
be counted among the <i>nouveaux riche</i>. Great
bunches of varied-colored coleus and red geranium
mingled with the greensward like a piece
of mosaic. Vines were beginning to grow over
the stone porch, and the whole bespoke comfort,
even luxury. Kent pulled the bell with a
sinking at heart, as he wondered who would
appear and what she would say. A servant,
not cleanly in apparel, opened the door after
long waiting. The true position of a family
can generally be seen through its domestics.</p>

<p>“Are the ladies of the house in?” asked the
college boy.</p>

<p>“What do you want of ’em?”</p>

<p>“I am selling a valuable book about the
‘Home.’”</p>

<p>“No, the missus don’t want it. She told me
as how she niver let a book-agent inside the
door, and she’d scold me if I called her. She
niver reads nothin’ but a novel&mdash;niver,” volunteered
the loquacious, but kind-hearted girl,
despite her torn apron and soiled hands.</p>

<p>At the next mansion Kent was told that the
“missus” had gone to the seashore; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
knowing look in the servant’s face showed that
she had been instructed to make this reply to
all callers. It sounded aristocratic to be at
Narragansett Pier or on the Atlantic coast,
even though finances would not permit of this
refreshing journey.</p>

<p>At the next house a kind-faced woman, who
really belonged to one of the old families, and
felt none too proud to open her own door, bade
the young man a pleasant “Good-morning,”
and though she did not wish to purchase the
book, which, though tastefully made, was commonplace
in subject, she thanked him for seeing
it, and hoped he would sell elsewhere. His
heart was a trifle lighter after this kindly greeting,
though his purse grew no heavier. At the
next house, and the next, he met with the same
refusals. Finally, near the end of the street,
the colored man who opened the door was also
striving to earn money for a college course.
He had been two years in Harvard University
already. Both father and mother were dead,
but from love for a girl who taught a colored
school he had become ambitious, and determined
to work his way through some institution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
The subject of the book touched his
heart. Katie, his school-teacher, would like it;
the suggestions about husbands and wives, and
the words about neatness, culture, and tenderness,
would do both good.</p>

<p>“How much is it?” said the colored youth.</p>

<p>“Two dollars.”</p>

<p>A disappointed look came into the face of
the would-be purchaser.</p>

<p>“I receive seventy-five cents commission,”
said Kent, “and I will let you have the book
for one dollar and a half; that will leave
twenty-five cents for my dinner.”</p>

<p>“I hate to ask you to take less, sir, but I
can’t pay two dollars, because I haven’t so
much. But here’s the one-fifty;” and he
added, as he held the book tenderly, “Katie
will so like it!” When a man is really in love
he can’t help telling somebody, even though it
be a book-agent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Grant Reynolds had been learning
his first experience of work in the broad
world, which has too little care for and sympathy
with toilers. He soon found that selling
books from house to house was no “lark,” as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
he had anticipated. His lips curled in disdain
as he was several times addressed rudely by
servants, or by women whom he knew were far
below him in social position. Did so many
fashionable people, then, have two methods of
action&mdash;one for the rich and the other for the
poor?</p>

<p>As he was thus musing, he opened a gate
and walked up to a beautiful mansion, Elizabethan
in style, that one would imagine to have
been just transported from England, with its
ivies and great beds of roses. He stopped
suddenly, for just before him a fair-haired girl,
in simple blue, with broad sun-hat wreathed
with daisies, was clipping a bunch of deep-red
roses. She looked up half inquiringly, as the
young man approached and lifted his hat. He
was not abashed&mdash;he had seen attractive girls
too often for that; but her kind look had an
unusual effect after the sharp refusals of the
morning.</p>

<p>The frank face of Grant could scarcely help
showing its appreciation of both girl and flower,
as he said, “I am canvassing for a book: ‘The
Past, Present, and Future of America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>’”</p>

<p>Perhaps the girl did not care much for the
book, but she liked the looks of the tall, manly
youth before her, and in her heart admired a
man who had energy and will enough to earn a
living for himself. Most young men whom she
had met had leaned upon their fathers; and it
was seldom difficult to tell what laurels they
would win in the jostle which we call life.</p>

<p>“May I see the book?” she asked, holding
out one white hand, while the other clasped the
roses.</p>

<p>“Can I hold the flowers while you look?”
said Grant, while a satisfied expression stole
about his mouth and large brown eyes.</p>

<p>“It is beautifully illustrated! I like pictures
of people greatly. I am always wondering
what they have accomplished, or will in the
future.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you are ambitious?”</p>

<p>“Yes; mamma thinks too much so for a girl.
I have wanted to go to college,” said the
natural young woman, “but she thinks it is
useless compared with my music.”</p>

<p>Grant hoped she would go on artlessly talking
about herself, but she suddenly changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the line of thought, as she said: “I am glad
to see a book about America&mdash;I love our
country! I have been with mamma to England
and the south of Europe, but I saw nothing
so dear as our own country and people. I
think our men the noblest in the world.”</p>

<p>There was no thought of compliment, for she
did not even look toward the young man to
whom she was apparently talking. At this
moment a woman, handsomely attired, stood in
the doorway, and with clouded brow bade her
come in.</p>

<p>“I was looking at a beautiful book, mamma,”
said Marion.</p>

<p>“We want no books of an agent,” said the
stern, proud woman. “If we need books we
buy them at Hamerton’s” (one of the largest
dealers in the East).</p>

<p>“I am in college,” said the young man,
piqued at the woman’s rudeness, and half
angered that the lovely girl should be found
fault with. “I am earning some money in this
way,” he added, not wishing to lie about the
matter, and yet rather enjoying this study of
human nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad to help poor young men,”&mdash;she
remembered when the shrewd Mr. Colwell, her
husband, made his first dollars in common
work at railroading,&mdash;“but I never buy of
agents! Why, we should be bored to death if
we did! Besides, I think our country is running
to education. Men who should be West
on farms are striving to go through college,
and then will starve as poor doctors or lawyers
in the busy cities. We need men to build our
railroads; Mr. Colwell says men are so scarce
and labor so dear that he has to import rough
foreigners. Education is the bane of common
folks. It spoils our girls. Look at those in
our high schools!&mdash;they’re too good to be
servants. While their mothers are toiling over
the wash-tub these young misses fit themselves
to be teachers. They’d better go West and
become farmers’ wives. They’ve got to marry
common people, for they can’t get rich men.”</p>

<p>Grant thought to himself how these educated
poor girls were to be the great moral force of
our country in its grand future; but he made no
answer as self-sufficient Mrs. Colwell went on:</p>

<p>“If Marion were to teach, why, all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
education would be good for her, perhaps; but
my daughter will never be obliged to.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t see the book, mamma,”
pleaded the girl, whose cheeks had become as
red as the roses which Grant had handed back
to her.</p>

<p>“No; and I’ve no time for it. Your father
is waiting to take you to drive. Besides, I
was surprised to see you conversing with a
stranger.”</p>

<p>The young man lifted his hat to Marion as
he passed out of the gate, but not till he had
said a word of thanks for her kindness to an
unknown student. He thought he saw the blue
eyes moisten as they looked up to his, showing
that she felt her mother’s harshness to a youth
who appeared to be working his way alone in
the world.</p>

<p>Marion Colwell was not given to sentiment,
but she wondered a thousand times what would
become of the handsome college boy, and she
could not help taking a bud from the flowers
which he held for her and pressing it between
the leaves of a book, with some tender yet
painful recollections. Marion seemed unusually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
quiet during the ride with her father, but no
word was spoken about the book-agent; for
Mr. and Mrs. Colwell lived so independently of
each other that the daughter never thought of
confiding her troubles to either.</p>

<p>At the end of the three hours the two college
students met to recount their experiences and
successes. Grant had not sold a single book,
but he drew from his pocket a red rosebud, and
showing it to Kent said: “I’m foolish, I do
believe; but I’ve seen a girl to-day who has
paid me a thousand times for all the annoyance
of being a book-agent. Perhaps I shall never
see her again, but I shall keep in memory one
lovely face, and I know she has a noble soul. I
took this bud, unbeknown to her, from a bunch
I held for her while she looked over that book.
I’ll not part with the book either, since she has
looked at its pictures.”</p>

<p>Kent did not make fun of him, for he had a
warm heart, and enjoyed the picture which
Grant drew of the fair young face. The vacation
came to its close. Some money had been
made by each of the three students, Grant
dividing his equally between James and Kent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="ls1">••••••••</p>

<p>Eight years had come and gone. James
Wellman was in business, and had become successful.
Kent had graduated with honor, but
gone home to his widowed mother to die.
Grant had studied theology, and for three years
had been settled in a Western city, whither he
had been drawn by his friend Wellman. A
July morning came like that on which he had
passed from house to house along the city
streets to sell books. The young minister stood
in his accustomed place, about to preach from
the well-known text, “Cast thy bread upon the
waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.”
A lady, dressed in blue, who was a stranger to
the congregation, entered, and was shown to a
seat well in front. She looked long and earnestly
at the speaker, as though she was aware
whom she had come to hear. For a moment,
as the minister caught a glimpse of the face,
he changed color, but immediately regained his
self-possession.</p>

<p>After the service he stepped directly down to
the pew, and the parishioners said to one another:
“Why, we didn’t know that the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
school-teacher, Miss Colwell, was a friend of
our pastor!”</p>

<p>He said, as he shook her hand, “I am glad
once more to thank you for your kindness of
years ago.” He spoke slowly, as one who has
had hopes and conquered them. “Is your
mother with you?” involuntarily rose to his
lips.</p>

<p>“No; I am alone, and teaching in your city.”</p>

<p>“I have been to your Eastern home, but was
told that you had gone West; and further than
that I could learn nothing.”</p>

<p>And then the past years were gone over.
Mr. Colwell had failed, not with honor, and had
been glad to go West, as his wife had recommended
Grant to do years before, and had
become lost in the whirl of a great city. Mrs.
Colwell allowed it to be reported that Marion
was to marry a rich widower. A wealthy
family came to occupy the Colwell mansion,
and society interested itself in the new and
forgot the old. And now Marion, poor and
unmarried, had come to the public school as
a teacher.</p>

<p>The minister called often at the school, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
finally the gossips suspected that the cause of
education was not the only motive for his visits.
Once when he called he laid down a pressed
and faded red bud. “Do you remember those
flowers I held so many years ago?” And,
blushing, she told him of a similar one which
she treasured.</p>

<p>A look of joy and half surprise came into his
face. “Did you, then, think of one whom you
supposed a poor boy, Marion?”</p>

<p>“And do you think of one who is in reality
a poor girl now?”</p>

<p>The wedding was a quiet one, Marion wearing,
at Grant’s request, a simple blue dress, with
red roses in her hand. What were Mrs. Colwell’s
thoughts as she looked at the book-agent,
now her son, no one could know, for poverty
had not made her less proud, but it had doubtless
made her more considerate and courteous.</p>

<p>“I would sell books again to find you,
Marion;” and her pretty blue eyes looked
their happiness in response.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">THE TWILIGHT HOUR SOCIETY.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">“HELÉNA, we must send out the invitations
this very afternoon for the new literary
society. It must be done with great care, too.
I wish this to be the most select club of the
West.”</p>

<p>The speaker was Mrs. Helen Brunswick, who
had just returned from Europe. She was
a lady of considerable culture and taste, and,
what was not an inconvenient addition, of
wealth. Her husband, a good business man,
had died&mdash;perhaps opportunely; for, though
Mrs. Brunswick was polite to him, she told her
bosom friends that “he was not poetical,” and,
therefore, not a very congenial spirit. His wife
was a teacher when he married her, poor, but
of very good family, and his money was undoubtedly
the chief attraction.</p>

<p>She had one child, whose name, for the sake
of elegance, she always called Heléna rather
than Helen, and of whom she was very fond;
but her one absorbing plan was to make her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
home a literary centre. She bought, on her
return from Europe, an old-fashioned house,&mdash;a
new one would have seemed vulgar to her
æsthetic taste,&mdash;and furnished it as nearly as
possible like the houses of some celebrated
persons which she had seen abroad. She
revelled in old tapestries, and bronzes which
looked as though they were made in the bronze
age.</p>

<p>Heléna sat down, note-book in hand, to make
out a list of those who were to be honored
members of the new association.</p>

<p>“Shall we invite Fanny Green, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, dear! She is only a local poet, getting
a few articles into the newspapers here and
there. This society will not be established to
help struggling newspaper writers or embryo
artists. These will make their way somehow if
they have talent, but the elegant ladies of Lakeville
will not care to associate with such crude
aspirants. We must take those from the very
highest walks of life, those who enjoy art especially,
and can prepare an essay on sculpture or
Egyptian lore. The young artists and novelists
are usually poor and hard workers, so they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
would have no time to look up these subjects,
which require great research and the leisure
that only a lady of wealth has.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, it would so help the rising
artists if their pictures could be brought before
the society. They would be purchased, probably,
for the elegant homes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Most elegant ladies want a picture
painted by a famous artist, so that when they
speak of the work to a friend the talent will be
seen at once.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they know talent when they see it,
whether John Smith or Bougereau painted it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no, Heléna! You must not ask
too much of people. I don’t care to read a book
unless a well-known name is on the title-page.
I consider it a waste of time. As soon as a
man has made his mark I am glad to read
him.”</p>

<p>The rising artists and the rising editors and
contributors were not invited to membership in
the new organization. Thirty-five names were
sent out.</p>

<p>“We must not have more than twenty-five in
the circle, Heléna, for large societies are never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
select. If there are but a few, and those very
literary, they will praise each other and feel
proud of the pleasure of belonging. There’s
everything in knowing how to handle women.
Let them think it is exclusive and there will be
a great longing to join; and when they cannot
be admitted, from the smallness of the number,
the society will become the leading topic of the
city. Each member, too, will be all the more
interested if she takes her turn in writing an
essay, and this would not be possible in a large
society.”</p>

<p>“Why, mother, half of those whom you have
named couldn’t write an essay!”</p>

<p>“Well, my child, they have some friend who
can help them. Money always buys help, and
usually of a very superior kind.”</p>

<p>The invitations were sent out, and in due
time the elegant ladies arrived. They admired
Mrs. Brunswick’s rugs, her choice bits of
needlework from abroad, and especially her
antique bronzes.</p>

<p>The first tribulation of the society was over
the adoption of a name. The “Mutual Club”
was suggested, but “club” seemed strong-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to some of the ladies present, and was
abandoned. One suggested the “Society for
Intellectual Growth,” but this seemed to suggest
labor, and it would not be best to suggest very
much work to such a charming circle. Mrs.
Brunswick herself suggested, after many others
had spoken, that the “Twilight Hour” would
be poetic and refining, and as the members
would usually come late in the afternoon, or in
the evening if some celebrity were invited, this
name would cover all times and seasons, convey
no impression of moral reforms, and
frighten no husbands with the fear that their
wives would become unsuited to pretty gowns
by mental wear.</p>

<p>This name was voted a happy thought, and
the plan proceeded. A committee on membership
was suggested, only twenty having responded
to the invitation, and five more could
be admitted. One lady, the wife of a senator,
must be secured at all hazards, and this committee
were to wait upon her at once. Another
lady had travelled nearly the world over,
and had several millions in her own right, and
must on no account be omitted. A third was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
selected for no especial reason except she had
held herself above ordinary society, and the
select had come to regard this as a sign of
aristocracy. Real aristocracy is too quiet to
attract much attention, but the unreal is very
prevalent.</p>

<p>The desired number was made up, and the
“Twilight Hour Society,” as was expected,
became the talk of Lakeville. A Gentlemen’s
Night was given occasionally, and those only
were invited who were supposed to be poetic.
There was a leaning toward the ministerial profession,
and a few judges and doctors were
permitted to enter the select circle. The time
came when it was necessary to invite a celebrity.
Mrs. Wentworth was talking the matter
over with Mrs. Brunswick.</p>

<p>“I hear,” said the former lady, “that the
author of the new book which has just appeared
in Boston, “The Story of a Life,” is to
be at Lakeville soon to visit a cousin. The
book is selling rapidly. It is a delightful
psychological story of a woman’s heart, I have
heard, and the men are as eager to read it as
the women. Mr. Smithnight, the author, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
become famous suddenly, and all the young
ladies are enthusiastic over him. He is quite
young, and very delightful, they say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Mrs. Brunswick, “anything
that comes from Boston is delightful! Society
is very deep there. The people are always
making a study of hidden things of the mind,
while we at the West are so very practical over
the bread and butter matters of life. Alas!
how far we are drifting from the beautiful and
the sublime! We must have Mr. Smithnight
at our next reception, and make it as elegant
as possible. How lovely those people are who
write books!”</p>

<p>The cousin of Mr. Smithnight, who lived on
a side street, and never would have been
thought worthy to step into the Twilight Hour
circle, was visited, and asked if a reception for
Mr. Smithnight could possibly be arranged.
The young Plato was glad to be shown off
before the admiring gaze of the uncultured
West, and readily consented to be present.</p>

<p>“Heléna,” said Mrs. Brunswick, as they
draped the mantel with smilax and lilies of the
valley, “I have always hoped that you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
marry an author. Perhaps in Mr. Smithnight
you will find your ideal.”</p>

<p>“I hope he’s handsome, mamma, and not
too conceited, as so many literary people
are.”</p>

<p>“I think you misjudge literary people, dear.
They must hold themselves aloof from general
society, else they would not be considered
so great. You know a writer across the water
always seems greater to us than our own
authors.”</p>

<p>The old-fashioned house of the Brunswicks
was lighted, not so gorgeously as to seem loud,
and fragrant flowers were in profusion. Very
elegant people came in their choicest robes to
pay allegiance to the new novelist. Had he
been a poet, he must needs have waited till
he was fifty for America to find out whether
he had genius or no; had he been a scientist,
he would not have won his fame till death
probably; but having given the public a well-written
book which sold, America at once pronounced
him a genius. Without doubt there
were wheels within wheels which procured its
publication. Perhaps he was a cousin to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
first-class novelist, or had a governor to recommend
his work; for how are publishers to know
when a thing will be a success? Nearly all the
great books, like “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” and
“Jane Eyre,” have been refused for months,
and even years.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithnight was present to receive the
homage of Lakeville. He had a fine, even
commanding, presence: black hair, which lay
lightly over his forehead, a stray lock drooping
occasionally, which his white hand tossed
back; expressive dark eyes; and a bland smile.
He was evidently a good student of human
nature, for, while he was egotistical,&mdash;successful
men usually have a good opinion of themselves,&mdash;he
had the tact to make every lady
feel that the intellectual culture of Lakeville
was something phenomenal. Mrs. Brunswick
thanked him heartily for coming, coming from
such a centre of knowledge as Boston, to stimulate
the over-practical West. She wanted to
enjoy his conversation at another time, when
she and dear Heléna could have him all to
themselves. As he took his departure he held
Heléna’s hand somewhat tenderly, and begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the pleasure of frequent visits during his short
stay at Lakeville.</p>

<p>“Heléna,” said Mrs. Brunswick, after the
guests had departed, “I think Mr. Smithnight
the most charming celebrity we have ever had.
Think how people will speak of it! I know of
nothing so delightful as a salon for literary
people. How many must envy me the rare
pleasure of bringing together these appreciative
people and these great people! You know
some of our celebrities from other cities have
been so dull and stupid, and read such non-understandable
essays, that our ladies have not
known what to say or do. I think some of the
manuscripts must have lain in trunks for years.
But Mr. Smithnight is so charming, so fresh
and entertaining! I think he likes you, Heléna,
for I saw him bestowing very admiring glances
upon you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t trouble myself much
about him. I liked him, though, well enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must be very polite to him, my dear,
for literary chances are so rare at the West!
Think where such a man would place you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithnight’s stay at Lakeville grew from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
days into weeks, and finally into months. He
was a frequent visitor at Mrs. Brunswick’s, and
rumor whispered that he was to wed Heléna.
Mrs. Brunswick made him the lion of the city.
She bought sundry copies of the “Story of a
Life,” and placed them where they would
receive glowing notices by the press, and be
read by the most select of Lakeville society.
She sent several copies abroad, telling the
recipients that it was written by a special friend
of Heléna’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithnight had found no such encouraging
aid in Boston. There a few mutual friends
helped each other, but the outside world
troubled itself little about the strugglers for
fame. At last it was publicly announced that
Mr. Smithnight and Heléna were engaged.
Some common-sense mothers wondered if he
had the ability to earn a living, knowing that
literature in general is not a paying business.
Some wondered whether he was able to spend
so much as he seemed to be doing weekly; but
marrying a young lady well-to-do might be an
effective way of meeting debts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brunswick would have preferred that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the young couple live with her, but Heléna
wished a house of her own, which was accordingly
purchased. Mr. Smithnight, with his
refined taste, helped in the selection of the
furniture and the bridal trousseau, and did not
hesitate to buy the best.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the last articles had
been purchased, a wild rumor was heard on the
street that Mr. Smithnight had been seen driving
out of town with a lady who was not Heléna
Brunswick; that many bills had been contracted
in Mrs. Brunswick’s name and left unpaid; and
that money had been obtained at the bank
fraudulently by the departing celebrity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brunswick was overwhelmed with the
news. Heléna was exceedingly annoyed, but
in no wise heart-broken, because for years she
had liked a poor young artist of the city, who
was not thought high enough to be invited to
the Twilight Hour Society.</p>

<p>The literary association finally disbanded.
Mrs. Brunswick sold the old-fashioned home and
moved to another city, holding no more receptions
for celebrities. Heléna married her poor
artist, who rose to eminence in his profession.</p>

<h2 class="p4">SLAVE AMY.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">IN NORTH CAROLINA over a century ago lived
Mr. John Payne, a wealthy planter, descended
from an earl’s daughter. He and
Thomas Jefferson, who afterwards became
President of the United States, both loved the
same beautiful girl, Mary Coles. She preferred
young Payne, and married him, and became the
mother of Dolly, the wife of President James
Madison, one of the most beloved women ever
in the White House.</p>

<p>Dolly was an uncommonly beautiful child,
and her fond mother, lest the sun should tan
her face, used to sew a sunbonnet on her head
every morning, and put long gloves on her
arms when she went to school.</p>

<p>Mr. Payne, her father, a Quaker, became
convinced that slavery was a sin, and sold his
plantation, freed his slaves, and moved to Philadelphia
in 1786. This was just after the
Revolutionary war, and the money of the
country had become depreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>John, his oldest son, was travelling in Europe,
and came home to help his father start in business.
Neither knew much about close economy,
or business methods, or the dishonesty of
some of their competitors. After a time Mr.
Payne failed, and the rich family was reduced
to poverty.</p>

<p>The father sank under his misfortune. A
wealthy young man by the name of Todd, of
excellent habits, had befriended Mr. Payne in
his pecuniary troubles. He wished to marry
Dolly, but she did not love him well enough.</p>

<p>The father called the young beauty of nineteen
to his dying bed and told her his wish
that she should accept John Todd. Dolly consented,
and thus made her father’s last days
happy. Mr. Todd proved a devoted husband,
but died of yellow fever three years after their
marriage, leaving Dolly with two little children,
one a baby of three weeks, who died soon after.
Two years later she married James Madison.</p>

<p>Mr. Payne and his beautiful wife, Mary Coles,
had always been kind to their slaves, so much
so that some refused to leave them, and came
to Philadelphia to live in their house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>One poor slave, called “Mother Amy,” when
freed, went out to service. She saved all her
money carefully; nobody could guess for what
purpose. She was unlettered, but she had the
gratitude and devotion characteristic of her race.</p>

<p>For herself she could endure poverty and
not mind it. She did not need or care for fine
clothes, but she could not bear that the woman
who was once her lovely owner should be in
reduced circumstances.</p>

<p>When death came for “Mother Amy” after
all the hard years of labor, she left five hundred
dollars, which she had struggled all the years to
save, to Mrs. Payne, her widowed mistress.</p>

<p>One does not have to look in elegant mansions,
or among the educated only, for the
noble virtues of self-sacrifice. No character is
fine or beautiful without it. “Mother Amy” left
a name and example worthy to be remembered.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">LIKE OUR NEIGHBORS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap03 p2">“WE MUST have a party,” said Mrs. Morris
to her husband. “I am under obligations
to Mrs. Raymond and Mrs. Nichols,
and to no end of ladies who have invited me to
their homes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we can afford it, wife, for
times are hard. I haven’t made a cent,
scarcely, in business during the past year.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will never do to let people know
that we are straitened. That would hurt your
business. Besides, the children are coming
on; and I must keep in society for their sakes.
I don’t want to have a party in a niggardly
way, either. We must have the house fixed up
to look as well as our neighbors’, and I must
have my last silk dress made over in the
present style.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morris sighed, for he found life a
struggle. If he had spent money for tobacco,
clubs, and the like, there might have been
some excuse for Mrs. Morris’s lack of economy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
but he was careful and saving, and, had
his wife been of a similar disposition, they
would have been in easy circumstances. As it
was, people wondered why she dressed so well,
and commented upon it; but she thought they
admired her good looks and fine appearance.
The world, after all, is fairly sensible, and
usually knows better than we think whether
people can afford fine houses and fine clothes.
There is seldom any great amount of deception.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris carried her points, as usual.
Money was borrowed; the dress was made
over; the guests were invited; and the Morris
party, with its flowers and supper and display,
was the talk of the hour, till it was forgotten in
the next sensation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris had to go to the seashore every
year, because her neighbors did. She left her
comfortable home; and for six weeks, while
Mr. Morris lived as best he could, she had the
joy of staying in a small, inconvenient, unattractive
room at a hotel, where she was kept
awake by noise in the corridors, missed the refreshing
shade of her own trees at home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was more tired at the end of the season than at
the beginning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris had to enlarge her house by a
music-room and a library, because her neighbors
did. She read little, but a library was a
good thing to have. It made one seem intellectual.
She was somewhat intelligent, but
superficial. As for music, she did not play
much; but sometimes her guests did, and a
music-room was an attraction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris had to have a good pew in
church, for she desired to be eminently respectable.
She had to give occasionally, or be
thought mean. She must be seen now and
then at concerts, operas, and lectures, or she
would not be in good society.</p>

<p>She had to have a horse and carriage, as
these were needed for making calls. She was
obliged to keep servants, because she was so
busy with social life. Had her visits been
among the poor or the unfortunate, they might
have helped the world; but her time now was
spent simply for her own social pleasure, and
with the thought, perhaps, that she was adding
to Mr. Morris’s popularity. He cared for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
home, however, far more than for the outside
world, and would have been happier had he
been permitted to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris, by persistent effort and tact,
had become quite a social leader. It never
seemed to occur to her that, when people lived
beyond their means, there must sometime be
a settlement.</p>

<p>This came one day when Mr. Morris was
severely injured by a street-car, lingered for
several months, and then died. It was a great
blow to Mrs. Morris in more ways than one.
When the income ceased the house was sold
to pay borrowed money, the parties and suppers
were over, the fine clothes disappeared,
and with them Mrs. Morris’s position in society.
The world forgot her. It was a hard lesson to
learn, but a lesson that many women have
learned to their sorrow. Yet many must travel
the old road of experience.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">TWO AT ONCE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">IT WAS the afternoon of May 15. A young
lady sat by an open window looking out
upon the hawthorn and laburnum trees, and yet
her thoughts seemed to be elsewhere.</p>

<p>About her was every luxury. The brick
house, in Queen Anne style, was set in the
midst of trees, many of them now in blossom,
or graceful with their seed-tassels. Far away
in the distance the ocean could be seen. The
girl herself added much to this charm of the
picture, as she rested her elbow upon her blue-velvet
writing-desk, where scores of addressed
envelopes were piled up. She took up one and
read the superscription&mdash;“Herbert Underwood,
7 Brompton Place.”</p>

<p>“I am really sorry. I wish it had not gone
so far,” she said aloud, as the color faded a
little from her cheek; “but then,” and the
color came back, “Herbert will not mind it
more than other men. They seem to forget
such things soon. I have loved him for years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as two may who grow up together, but other
girls are ready to accept him.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he will really care much. He
will be surprised when he reads these cards
announcing my marriage to another. Engaged
to two at once! I suppose they will say I am
a coquette. It is so delightful to be admired&mdash;to
be loved. I really wish I had told him
that Robert loves me also. Robert is not
richer nor handsomer, but Herbert seems
more like a brother.</p>

<p>“Besides, it will be so charming to live in
Washington, and meet all the celebrities. I
hope it is not frivolous, for I suppose all girls
like society. I wonder what Herbert will do.
Perhaps he will write me that he is broken-hearted;
perhaps he will come in person and
rebuke me. He is very proud, though, and I
think he will bear it bravely. I had a friend
who engaged herself to two at once, and the
rejected young man shot himself. I hope
Herbert will not do that!”</p>

<p>The cards were sent, and preparations went
forward for a grand wedding. Dresses were
tried on, and boxes of presents were opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with eager curiosity&mdash;those offerings which
usually mean so little, and cramp the recipients
for the next ten years in returning like favors.
There was nothing from Herbert&mdash;not even a
letter.</p>

<p>“How strange!” said the expectant bride.
When Mr. Underwood received the cards he
was indeed confounded, not heart-broken, for
though he had long loved Clara Rawley he had
questioned for some time her complete devotion
to him.</p>

<p>She had been a society prize&mdash;rich, pretty,
admired. He, likewise of fine family, could
have won many. It was of course a disappointment,
a humiliation. His friends would
know it, and wonder at it. Some men would
have taken a hasty departure to Europe; some
would have been embittered by a young
woman’s double dealing. He determined,
perhaps not the most honorable thing for him,
to recompense evil for evil.</p>

<p>By wise investigation he ascertained at what
hour the happy bridegroom, Robert Spalding,
was expected at the home of his betrothed, and
decided to meet him on the train previous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his arrival. They had met each other once or
twice, and thus it was not difficult to discern in
the crowded cars the handsome face of his rival.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spalding, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Oh, I remember you&mdash;Mr. Underwood,
the friend of Miss Rawley! Glad to see
you; sit down.”</p>

<p>Presently the conversation turned upon the
approaching wedding, and then with apparent
calmness, but with indignation, Herbert told
him how he had been engaged to Miss Rawley
for several years, and of her perfidy.</p>

<p>Mr. Spalding listened with astonishment,
and when he had finished, lost faith, ceased to
find her the ideal of his life. She had been
faithless to one; she might be to another. She
certainly was undeserving of the love he had
given her. He determined, then and there, to
retrace his steps, and sent her a telegram, followed
by a letter, telling her of the withdrawal
of his hand.</p>

<p>The Rawley family were in consternation
when the letter was received. Clara was piqued,
angered, and became ill over it, and was sent to
Europe. The careless if not heartless girl had
been punished.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE HOUSE-WARMING.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap14 p2">“ALMOST ready for the great event,” said
Mr. Josiah Midland, portly and genial,
to his wife Martha, as they stood on the porch
of a two-story brick house, nearly completed.
“I want the new house for you, Martha, and I
want it also, I must confess, to show the people
of Collinston that Josiah Midland has been a
financial success. You know life has been a
struggle since I left this town a boy, and worked
my way on the railroad to a place of trust.
Life is not an easy thing for the best of us, and
where the one gains in the race, the many are
so bound by the needs of every day that they
can never rise above their surroundings. I kept
good habits and saved my money. I owe that
teaching to my hard-working mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have been a great success,” said
the thin and careworn wife, who had shared his
struggles and did not possess his buoyant temperament
to throw off the wear of daily life.
“I almost dread to have a house-warming, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it will cost so much and bring no end of work.
I should like to have the people see our beautiful
home, but you know I cannot shine in society.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Midland looked up to her husband as
the great factor in their worldly gains, and so
he was; but he owed much to the economy and
good sense of the quiet woman who was glad
to be his helper.</p>

<p>“Oh, you will shine enough, Martha, so that
I shall be proud of you! After the furniture is
once in the house we will invite everybody&mdash;yes,
everybody, rich and poor. It’s great folly
for a man to make social distinctions for himself
as soon as he has a few thousands. I want
to have them all enjoy the house. It’s the
handsomest house in the village, and they’ll all
be glad to come. The caterer will provide the
supper, and you’ll just have to shake hands
with the guests and look pleased.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I had better wear,
Josiah?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must have a new dress for the
occasion! I like garnet. Get a garnet silk with
a good deal of velvet, and you’ll look handsome;”
and Mr. Midland smiled in his big-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
way that had won him friends from his
boyhood.</p>

<p>The new moon had risen in the west, and
the stars were coming out brightly, as if all
nature even was glad at Mr. Midland’s success.
As they left the house the church bell rang out.</p>

<p>“Let us go,” said Mr. Midland. “The minister
told me the other day that an evangelist
was coming here. I forgot all about it, but it
might pay us to go and hear him once. Religion
isn’t a thing of emotion to me, but I like
to hear good preaching. I’ve never had any
notion of joining a church myself, but I don’t
know what the community would be without
the churches. Property would go down pretty
quickly.”</p>

<p>The minister, as was human, felt the blood
quicken in his veins as the successful railroad-man
and his wife entered. Not that they
were more important than poor people, but
he knew that money consecrated to good ends
is a power almost unlimited. He could only
silently pray that some word would be uttered
which would touch Mr. Midland’s heart.</p>

<p>The young evangelist preached not an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sermon, but a simple talk upon the
power of a good life&mdash;a life that came but
once and was spent so quickly. Mr. Midland
sat like one awakened out of sleep. True, he
had made money; he had a good moral character;
but he would go through life but once,
and he was living entirely for himself. He
had never realized what a wonderful gift from
heaven this life is, with all its possibilities to
help others, to make the poor comfortable, the
sad happy, to remove the causes of crime and
discontent. He seemed, all at once, to have
made a voyage of discovery, and to have found
a new land.</p>

<p>He said little on the way home, except to
tell Martha that he felt strangely, and that she
must go to bed and sleep, but he would sit up
awhile and think. Mr. Midland did think long
and carefully by the shaded lamp. He thought
over his whole past experience. He had been
prospered, and he owed all to a Higher Power.
And after he had thought, he prayed.</p>

<p>In the morning he said: “Martha, I have
given up the house-warming. I have decided
to use the money to send a boy to college to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
become a preacher;” and then he added, “for
a man who turns the life of another heavenward
does the greatest work in the world, and I must
help to do the greatest hereafter.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Midland looked confused for a minute,
and then she said, half audibly, “I am very
glad, Josiah.” After that night Mr. Midland’s
face took on an expression that was noted till
his death, years afterward. It was as though
he had talked with the angels, and joined a new
brotherhood. The genial man became more
genial, more considerate, more self-controlled.
It became literally true that, like his Master,
“he went about doing good.” Without children
of his own, he devoted his property to the giving
of the Gospel to the people. He joined heartily,
by voice and money, in all that elevated mankind.
He built houses for the poor; he educated
orphans; he held prayer-meetings in
sparsely-settled districts; he labored for temperance;
he became the idol and ideal man of
the community. He carried out his plan of
using the house-warming money to educate a
young man for the ministry, and lived to see
his gift return a thousand-fold interest.</p>

<h2 class="p4">HANNAH AND JOE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">IN THE YEAR 1851 Captain Budington, of
Groton, Conn., passed the winter in Cumberland
inlet, west of Greenland. Here he
met Joe and Hannah on the island of Kim-ick-su-ic,
so called because its flat centre, covered
with grass, resembles a dogskin. Hannah was
twelve years old, dressed in fur pantaloons and
short fur overdress, and bore the name of Too-koo-li-too
in her own language. Joe was a
good deal older, and his real name was Ebierbing.</p>

<p>A few years afterward a merchant from Hull,
England, Mr. Bolby, met them at Cumberland
gulf, where they had come off the island to
trade, and prevailed upon them to take the long
journey to England. When he reached home
he made a large company, and in the presence
of these guests the young woman Hannah was
married to Joe. Mr. Bolby took them to several
places in England and Scotland, and they
were finally presented to Queen Victoria and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Prince Albert. The Queen was deeply interested
in these people from the far North
in British America, and asked them to dine
with her. If the Queen was pleased with the
sincere, uneducated, fur-dressed pair, Hannah
was no less pleased with the gracious Queen in
her elegant home, so entirely different from a
snow hut. She always said Victoria was “very
kind, very much lady.” After two years they
returned to Cumberland inlet, and in 1860
Charles F. Hall, the explorer, met them.</p>

<p>Everybody in both England and America
had become deeply interested in the fate of Sir
John Franklin. He had left England in 1845
with two ships, the “Erebus” and “Terror,” with
one hundred and thirty-four persons, in search of
the North Pole. After two years relief parties
were sent out to find them. Lady Franklin spent
all her large fortune in sending out ships to
search for her missing husband.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1850, the graves of three of the
men were found at the far North, on Beechy
island, west of Hannah’s home, so that the
course which Franklin took was known. Four
years later Dr. Rae, of England, heard from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the Eskimos that a large company of white
men had starved on King William Land, far to
the northwest of Baffin’s bay, and he obtained
from the Eskimos many articles which belonged
to Franklin and his men.</p>

<p>After England had spent over five million
dollars in searching for Franklin it was ascertained
that both his ships had gone to pieces in
the ice off the west coast of King William
Land, and that his poor men had starved and
frozen, as they wandered over the ice in a vain
search for food or friends. Then skeletons
were found in boats or in snowbanks, and their
boots, watches, and silver had become the
property of the Eskimos. Sir John died two
years after the ships left England, and must
have been buried in the ocean.</p>

<p>Some persons believed that the Franklin
party were not all dead. Charles Francis Hall
was an engraver at Cincinnati, O. He was
poor, and with no influential friends, but he
felt that the Lord had called him to the work
of finding some of the Franklin men. He read
all he could find about Arctic life. He asked
money of prominent men and learned societies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and finally, after enough obstacles to discourage
any other man, obtained funds to build
a boat and put up twelve hundred pounds
of food for the journey. A New London firm
gave him a free passage on one of their ships,
and he went, in 1860, to the far North, discovering
relics of Sir Martin Frobisher’s expedition,
made three hundred years before.
His boat was lost, so he had to return to
America, and brought with him Joe and Hannah,
who had been with him two years, and
who were devotedly attached to him.</p>

<p>In 1864 Hall started again with Joe and
Hannah, and north of Hudson bay lived five
years among the Eskimos, eating their raw
food and living in their igloos or snow huts.
Joe, with great skill, would kill a walrus, which
sometimes weighs two thousand pounds, or
would watch two whole nights near a hole in
the ice where the seal comes up to breathe,
that he might spear it for his master.</p>

<p>In 1866, May 14, the only child of Joe and
Hannah died, while on one of Hall’s journeys.
According to custom, the distracted mother at
the plain funeral carried the dead baby in a fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
blanket suspended from her neck. Captain
Hall put this note in the fur cap covering the
head of the child: “These are the mortal remains
of little King William, the only child of
Ebierbing and Too-koo-li-too, the interpreters
of the lost Franklin Research Expedition.
God hath its soul now, and will keep it from
harm.”</p>

<p>Later, Hall visited King William Land, and
brought away one hundred and twenty-five
pounds of relics of Franklin and his men.
Among these was a complete skeleton, proved
from the filling of a tooth to be that of an
officer of the ship “Erebus.” Hall felt sure now
that all the party were dead. Joe and Hannah
came back to the States with Hall, bringing
a little three-year-old girl whom they adopted.
They bought her of her parents for a sled.
Hannah named her Sylvia Grinnell, after the
Grinnell family, celebrated for their gifts towards
Arctic research, but her real name was
Punna.</p>

<p>Captain Hall made his third voyage in the
ship “Polaris” in 1871 for the North Pole, taking
his devoted Joe and Hannah and little Punna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
He reached a higher point in Smith sound than
had been reached by any other vessel at that
time, and anchored in a harbor protected by
an iceberg four hundred and fifty feet long and
three hundred broad, calling the place Thank
God harbor. In the autumn of this year Hall
died very suddenly, and his men spent two
days in digging a grave only two feet deep.
He was buried at eleven in the forenoon, but so
dark was it in that high latitude that lanterns
were carried. Poor Hannah sobbed aloud at
the death of her best friend. The party on
the “Polaris” determined to return, but, being
caught in the ice, were obliged to abandon her
and throw the provisions and clothing out on
the ice-floe. In the midst of this work, in the
night, the ship drifted away, with fourteen persons
on board, leaving on a piece of ice one
hundred yards long and seventy-five broad
Captain Tyson and eight white men and nine
Eskimos, including three women and a baby
eight weeks old. Hannah and Punna were
among them.</p>

<p>A dreadful snow-storm came on, and the
shivering creatures huddled together under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
some musk-ox skins. Later they built a little
house from materials thrown out of the ship,
and floated down Baffin’s bay and Davis strait,
the ice constantly crumbling and the sea washing
over them. They used all their boats save
one for fuel, and were only kept alive through
the heroic efforts of Joe and another Eskimo,
Hans, who caught some seals for them, which
were eagerly eaten uncooked, without removing
the hairy skin. They had only a little mouldy
bread, and the sufferings of the children from
hunger were painful to witness.</p>

<p>Once, when nearly all were dead from starvation,
Joe saved them by killing a bear. He and
Hannah refused to leave Captain Tyson and the
party when they were drifting past their homes
at Cumberland inlet, even when it was probable
that the Eskimos themselves must be used for
food by the famished white men. After drifting
one thousand five hundred miles in six
months (one hundred and ninety-six days),
one of the most thrilling journeys on record,
the party were rescued off the coast of Labrador
by the English ship “Tigress.”</p>

<p>Hannah and Joe settled at Groton in 1873, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a little house purchased for them by their good
friend, “Father Hall.” Joe became a carpenter,
and Hannah made up furs and other articles on
her sewing-machine.</p>

<p>The next year Hannah, at the age of thirty-eight,
died of consumption, her health broken
by the exposure on the ice-floe. She had long
been an earnest Christian, loving and reading
her Bible daily. She was tenderly cared for by
Mrs. Captain Budington and others, saying at
the last, “Come, Lord Jesus, and take thy
poor creature home!” A handsome stone
marks the grave of the faithful Hannah in the
cemetery. Joe came often to the graves on the
hillside of Groton, and said at last, “Hannah
gone! Punna gone! Me go now again to
King William Land; I have to fight; me no
care.” He went with Lieutenant Schwatka in
the Franklin search party, June 19, 1878, and
never returned to the United States.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">BURTON CONE’S REASON.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap03 p2">YEARS after Coleridge wrote the beautiful
“Hymn before Sunrise in the Valley of
Chamouni,” which Felicia Hemans said she
would give all her poems to have written,&mdash;among
a group of strangers standing in awe
before Mont Blanc was a man who seemed
forty-five, from his hair fully half gray and his
quiet, dignified bearing, though he must have
been younger. He was absorbed in his own
thoughts. He did not look at any face about
him, but seemed spell-bound by the sublimity
of the scene. In that vast mountain, white
with eternal snows, with the rivers, fed by the
glaciers, turbulent at its base, the sun clothing
it with rainbows, he saw the same God who
had compassed his life, as the stalwart pines
hedged in the grand mount before him.</p>

<p>After a time, as through that as yet undeveloped
science of unseen power between mind
and mind, he felt a presence. He was conscious
of eyes fixed upon him, conscious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
somebody he had known and loved was near
him. A hand was laid on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Burton, you’re the last man in all the world
I thought of seeing. Ten years since you
and I travelled together, and you yet on the
wing? I supposed you had settled down to
some life-work, and was surrounded by loves
and cares ere this. You and I have stood here
together before.”</p>

<p>The speaker was a genial, generous man,
somewhat Cone’s junior in look and manner,
whose sorrows, whether many and great or not,
could not long crush his happy heart. His
sympathies were quick, his hopes naturally
bright, and his nature ardent. The decade
that had passed since the former companionship
had aged one more than the other. The
one had been giving time and heart to business,
but had lived alone, though a crowded
world was about him. The other had been
kept young and fresh by the love of a cheerful
wife and sunny daughter, and the years had
gone by rapidly and more than ordinarily well
stored with good deeds.</p>

<p>“Come, Burton, I am tiring of this road and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
grandeur. Let’s go back to the hotel and have
one of the old friendly talks. Nature has lost
half its beauty now that only one pair of eyes
sees it&mdash;and I have no one to tell of the
beautiful or strange things I have seen. You
don’t need friendship as I do. You are made
of sterner stuff. You are Mont Blanc personified.”</p>

<p>Cone’s mind was full of the grandeur before
him, but his heart, cold as he was, was keenly
alive to the needs of those who had been
friends, so together they walked arm in arm to
their lodgings.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s talk over the ten years, Cone.
Ten years make a fool or a wise man of a
fellow&mdash;carry him up to the gates or down to
the depths.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what they have done for you,
Marsh. You know how much I have to thank
you and your young wife for the sunshine you
put into my life when we travelled together
before. She seemed like a sister to me. She
understood me; and that is where most women
fail. They do not know us, or we do not know
them, so our true natures never come side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
side; but she seemed to feel the pulse of my
life. She knew just when I needed jovial
words and when I needed sympathy or quiet.
She had the tact I have heard so often described,
but seldom seen, and a pure, good heart back
of it. I fear all hasn’t gone right with you.
Can it be that you are walking alone, like
myself?”</p>

<p>Tears gathered in Marsh’s eyes. He had
almost a woman’s heart and a woman’s love.
“It isn’t hard for you to stand alone, but for
me it is crushing. I buried my wife in
England six months ago. We came for her
health, but she failed rapidly and went away
soon after we arrived. Our little girl is boarding
with friends, and I wander anywhere,
everywhere,&mdash;so I can forget. I cannot go
back to America. Nothing binds me there. I
seem unfit for labor, and I am adrift. You
know she was like an anchor. I depended
upon her judgment, upon her help, upon her
love. When a woman leans entirely upon a
man, and she is taken away, he may feel as
though something dear and beautiful had gone
out from him; but when a woman has strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
enough to be a companion, a counsellor, in
the deeds and plans of every day,&mdash;when she
is not a pet merely, but a guide to everything
noble,&mdash;when, whether you will or not, you
are kept upon a plane of right and duty and
manhood,&mdash;what shall a poor relying heart
do?”</p>

<p>“Would you wish to forget, Marsh? I
would put such a blessing away in my heart
and grow strong from daily looking at it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t keep it, Cone. I must get away
from such memories. I feel as though I
drifted hither and thither, because there is no
hand on the helm. To remember is misery:
to forget might be relief.”</p>

<p>“And yet, do you not owe such a wife a
loving, yearning remembrance? One might
forget a flower that blossomed for his pleasure
for a day or a week; but hold in grateful
memory a spring that opened in the desert of
a parched life and became an unfailing supply.
Memories sometimes are almost as sweet as
present realities, and sometimes we are made
even stronger by the one than by the other.”</p>

<p>“That may be good philosophy for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
who have never loved and lost. No one can
know till he has the trial. I have one left, I
know, but that does not fill the place of the
other, and perchance no one ever could.”</p>

<p>“You must go back with me to our fatherland.
I am nearly through my journeying,
for it seems idle work for me now. Besides, I
have had premonitions that I should make
ready for another journey. You seem startled.
Ten years have worn upon me, for they have
been years of constant and hard labor. I could
not forget, and would not; but hope will fade
into fruition by and by.”</p>

<p>“Cone, you ought to tell me of your life.
Much as you respected my wife, you never
raised the curtain from the scenes which transpired
before we met you. Why have you
lived to your age, and taken no heart into your
own to bless and hold? Your principles are
like adamant, and would keep you anywhere,
but every man and woman needs to have his or
her heart uncloistered, that others may grow
strong and unselfish with him. This working
out life’s plan alone, with no giving or receiving
of loves, seems a mistake to me. Has your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
heart anything hidden away in it, or are you
proof to what you may think the weaker acts
of life?”</p>

<p>Cone’s face seemed a little troubled. Not
one man or woman out of ten thousand
reaches the age of forty without having loved
or been loved, and felt blessed joy or bitter
pain in one or the other. Was he indeed
different from the rest of mankind? He manifested
no partiality for women, except a deference
that everybody pays to what it supposes
exalted and ennobling. He had received
numerous proofs of their esteem for him, and
indications that they would not repel his attentions.
He was often the subject of remark,
from his striking face and manner, but when
all the queries had been asked and unanswered
they said, “There must be a reason for all this,
and time will tell it.”</p>

<p>He had been touched in heart by Marsh’s
utter helplessness. He knew better than anybody
else what a centre she had been to his
thought and his affections. He sympathized
with him. Perhaps the doors of his own inner
sanctuary, locked for a half-score years, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
swing back just once, and let a weary friend
come in and find consolation.</p>

<p>“Come to-night, Marsh, and I will talk with
you. Good-by till then.”</p>

<p>Alone and unperceived he stole out to sit
under the majestic shadows of Mont Blanc, and
worship. Nobody with a God in his heart ever
stands there without holding communion with
Him. No wonder that the lofty peaks, echoing
cañons, and wondrous waterfalls of our own
country have written the names of more than
one poet on the pages of American literature!
Such scenes are the nurseries in which great
minds develop. Such grand handiwork of the
Builder draws every man very near to Him.</p>

<p>Burton Cone had never forgotten the scenes
through which he had passed. Though some
things had been laid away and sealed with the
seal of silence for over a dozen years, they
were fresh to him as though they had taken
place that very morning. Perhaps he did
not need sympathy as some need it; perhaps
he did not wish to burden others with his
feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed almost twilight in the room, the
lights were turned down so low.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Marsh, till we talk of the past.
You have wondered if there is anything back of
this life you have known. Aye, much, very
much! You have wondered if I ever loved,
and why I did not love some one now, when I
so reverence woman. Away back in New England,
in a little town near a beautiful city on
the Connecticut, is the home of my childhood.
That is precious to me, though I have not seen
it for years. Near it is a large brick house,
painted white, with long rows of firs and pines
leading to it. It looks like an old castle. In
that home was a young girl who from her
childhood was my ideal. We played together
as children, we roamed through the woods and
meadows, we read and sang and talked of
things beyond our years, because her nature
held me above myself. She was not beautiful
to others, perchance; but to me her large dark
eyes, high brow, and glossy hair, with her quiet,
dignified manner, made her a queen. She
never seemed to do wrong. She had to ask
no one’s forgiveness. She never made mistakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
She had no need for regrets. Nobody
thought to be rude or rough to Mary Fairchild,
or in her presence. She was always calm,
always genial and kind, always considerate.
She never seemed like the rest of us. I fancied
she had been sent from heaven to keep our
earthly minds and tastes somewhat akin to
theirs. I always feared she might at any time
take her departure to the land where she
seemed rightly to belong.</p>

<p>“She went away to receive her education,
and I studied hard to make myself, if possible,
some day worthy of her. Occasionally she
wrote me, and those letters seemed to me of
peculiar value. I read each one over and over
again, till I knew every word and how every
letter was made. The slightest allusion to friendship
for me seemed a mine of joy, and I put
the letter next my heart to read as often as I
should get a little leisure. She never gave me
encouragement that she loved me more than
others, always treating us all in the same
gracious, kindly way. I was naturally timid,
and though I did not tell her I loved her
my desire to be in her company, my extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
joy when I met her, my blushing cheeks and
my glad eyes, must have told her over and over
again that I idolized her. I was active, energetic,
ardent, but I lacked her spirituality and
finer qualities of soul. She revelled in all that
was beautiful and artistic. I never expected
that she could love me as I did her. I thought
her nature too ethereal, but I hoped that I
might sometime live in her presence and be
guided by her blessed spirit in my daily life.</p>

<p>“Nothing could have been farther removed
from coarseness or passion than my love for
Mary; I never pressed my lips to hers. So I
could be near her, hear her voice, and live
in the sunshine of herself, I was content. I
went out from her society a better man each
time. I would go any distance, endure any
exposure, so I might but feel the blessed light
of her eyes come into mine. I never joked
with her as I might others. I never used her
name before any person. I never wrote it
carelessly. Everything pertaining to her was
sacred as the heaven which I sometime expected
to enter. My highest thought was her
happiness, not mine. My ambition, my hopes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
my prayers, all centred in that one desire to
walk beside her in the beautiful journey of life.
When any person coupled my name with hers
in pleasantry I felt as though they had touched
a name that was hallowed, and changed the
subject. I longed to be constantly in her
presence, yet dared not trouble her too much;
so between desire to hover near and fear of
being an annoyance rather than a joy my soul
was constantly harassed. I had often pledged
myself to ask her to accept my homage, and
though I had means and social position and
education, everything seemed unworthy of her.
What if she refused to be my guide forever?
Life then would be worse than useless; so,
hoping and praying, I waited, and my worship
grew as the months went by. Every flower
that she loved I pressed and laid away in the
books I had seen her read. Every kindly word
she gave me made me joyful for days. Every
touch of her hand thrilled me with delight, and
I lived over the bliss a thousand times in
memory. Once, I remember, when I gave her
a picture of myself, and she looked at it long
and earnestly I thought, and her dark hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
touched mine, I was too happy for words to
express it.</p>

<p>“Other young men called upon her, and, like
myself, showed her the deference that belonged
to a pure, beautiful woman, girl though she
was in years. Among them was a noble young
man, the perfection of manly grace and the
embodiment of manly virtues. Alfred Trumbull
was a preacher, a genial, earnest, eloquent
young man, as spiritual as herself. I had met
him there and had learned to love him. He
admired her, we all plainly saw, but she treated
him as the rest, with a cordiality that was
blended with reserve and that kept us all removed
just far enough to worship her.</p>

<p>“Weeks went by. I was growing wretched.
I was coming to know how entirely dependent
I was upon her for happiness. If a day passed
by and I did not see her, it was a lost day. I
must tell her and have her all my own. Oh,
Marsh, those were glad days, after all,&mdash;when
I could see her, if no more,&mdash;but God and
time shape things differently from what we
will!</p>

<p>“It was just such a night as this. I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
her so plainly&mdash;how I stood by the gate and
watched the shadows of the pines flicker on the
walk, and, man though I was, trembled to take
the final step. She met me so cordially, more
than was her wont, I thought. She was so
lovely on that calm summer evening; so doubly
frail, too, that my solicitude for her kept pace
with my love. She was alone. With no sound
save the rustle of the pines, and no one to hear
save God and her, I told her all my heart. I
told her how I worshipped her with all the
strength of my being. I told her how I would
struggle to the end of life to make myself
worthy of her.</p>

<p>“She waited a full minute before she answered
me. In that minute it seemed as though
my reason would give way. She was so white
with the moonlight streaming in upon her, as
she put her hand in mine and said, with an
irrepressible tenderness, ‘Burton’ (and nobody
else spoke my name as she did), ‘Burton, I
have promised to help Alfred Trumbull win
souls.’</p>

<p>At first I was dumb; then I buried my face
in my hands and groaned aloud, then I wept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
like a child that cannot be comforted. Oh,
Marsh, there is nothing that bends a man’s
soul like that! I felt alone&mdash;no support, no
guide, no love, no hope. Life was worse than
a blank; a dull, dread certainty of sorrow. It
would be torture to die if death were to remove
me from her sight&mdash;it would be torture to live
and never have her love or presence. Those
were bitter days, full of the depths of sorrow.
Those days made me grow old a score of years.
I was never young afterward.</p>

<p>“At last, when I could command myself, I
begged to be allowed to love her till my life
went out. If any one could win her instead of
me, I was thankful to have it one so good as
Alfred Trumbull. I conquered self. I found
my highest happiness was still to see her
happy. Sometimes when I visited her the old
love, the yearning to claim her for myself,
would sweep over me till my head grew dizzy
and my heart sank within me, and then my
better nature said: ‘Rejoice in her joy, and be
content only to love.’</p>

<p>“I came at last to be resigned&mdash;yes, happy
in my idol-worship. From her I could hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
for nothing but kindness and tenderness, but I
could never love any other. The time drew
near when she and Alfred Trumbull were to
commence their grand life-work. Suddenly his
health failed. She went to him&mdash;she cared
for him day and night with the same intensity
of love that I had given her. It could not
arrest disease. He longed for returning health,
because they would have been so happy and
congenial in their love and work; but one day
in early spring he died in her arms, and was
laid away among the first flowers, to rest from
his labors.</p>

<p>“I never saw a life so blighted as hers. Her
whole heart lay beside his in the grave. She
lost all interest in life. She grew quiet and sad
and more ethereal. She never mentioned his
name, but we knew she longed to live with him,
even though she must pass through the valley
of the shadow.</p>

<p>“Against all my struggling I found my old
desire to claim her coming back into my soul.
I showed her all the delicate yet unobtrusive
kindness possible. Her very sorrow made her
unspeakably dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“After Alfred had been in heaven a year,
and knowing that she loved no one else, I told
her again the old burden of my heart. She
seemed moved to pity as she laid her hand on
mine, just as she did once before, and said in
tones I shall never forget, ‘Burton, I am
Alfred’s!’</p>

<p>“I lived over again the old days of torture,
and again conquered self to minister to her
happiness. I should have died if I could not
have loved her, and I was almost happy that
she did not deny me this. I gathered beautiful
and rare things for her, and in all ways made
her life less sad, if possible. I must have her
to care for and love and serve, and again I laid
my affection at her feet. With the same sad
smile she had borne for three years, she said,
looking down at the mourning robes she had
worn for him, ‘Burton, I am Alfred’s still; but
if I can make your life any happier I will be
your wife!’</p>

<p>“Those words staggered me. I had not
dared hope for this, though I prayed for it.
Joy seemed to take away my senses; and seeing
me so beside myself the old look came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
back once or twice to her face. I was as one
who, shipwrecked in mid-ocean, after clinging
for days to a floating plank, at last picked up
by a stray ship, is helpless through joy and
gratitude. I was more dead than alive with my
wealth of happiness. Mary and I were made
one. Marsh, how I live over again those beautiful
days. I used to look at your pretty wife
beside you as we journeyed, and think of my
precious Mary.</p>

<p>“My cup of joy was full to the brim. She
accepted my homage, and was grateful. I
spared no pains to make her life complete. To
have her in my home, to have the blessed influence
of her presence evening after evening,
was the crowning joy of a man who had loved
for years in silence and unreturned affection.</p>

<p>“I was so entranced with my joy that another
summer had come round again before I
began to realize that she was fully mine, and
then the next winter flew so rapidly, and a little
son came into the household. We were both
very grateful&mdash;I all the more because I
thought it might fill Mary’s heart something
as the old love had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“I watched her cheeks grow brighter as she
fondled the boy, whom I named Alfred for her
sake. They were so beautiful in my home,
mother and child. I worked with redoubled
energy, and well nigh forgot that there was any
heaven beyond, my joy was so complete below.</p>

<p>“Spring came and I gathered wild flowers to
wreathe the brows of both. One day, while
absent from home, a message came for me
that my wife was ill and desired me to come.
I grew palsied with fear. I hastened home to
find her just able to speak to me. She had had
a violent hæmorrhage of the lungs. I was wild.
I knelt before her, and clasping her in my
arms begged her not to die, but live for my
sake and her boy’s. She put her white arm
about my neck, drawing me to his little face
and hers, as she said faintly, ‘Burton, keep the
darling child, who is ours,&mdash;but I&mdash;I am Alfred’s!’&mdash;and
was gone.</p>

<p>“For months I did not know what happened.
All was a blank. My boy died before I came
to myself, and I was alone again in the world.
I travelled till my health permitted work, and
then I labored incessantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“I love Mary now as I loved her so long ago.
No other can ever fill her place. She is as
much mine to love as ever. All this has whitened
my hair, you see. I must lock up my
heart again, lest the world look in upon my
idols. Do you see that I have reason for not
loving again?”</p>

<p>Marsh’s head was bowed. He loved Cone as
a brother, and he had suffered all this and loved
on, and was brave and strong.</p>

<p>“Let us take my little girl and go back to
yours and Mary’s home,” said Marsh.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Mary has an only sister strangely
like your wife. You need another heart to lean
upon. Your nature is different from mine.”</p>

<p>Not many years after Marsh had taken the
sister to be a mother to his pretty daughter, and
Burton Cone, leaving his property to this little
one, had been laid to rest by the side of Mary.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">UNSUITABLE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">“IT NEVER will happen,” said Jane Holcomb
to her sister Nancy, as they sat together
before an open fire. “Justus is too bright a
young man to fall in love with a woman nearly
twice his own age. Think of our educating our
only nephew at a most expensive college, having
all our hopes centred in his future prominence,
and then have him make an unsuitable marriage!”</p>

<p>“But we have never seen this woman he
seems to love,” said Nancy quietly. “Perhaps
we should like her. I think she must have
some admirable qualities, or Justus would never
be fond of her. Besides, he is a favorite with
ladies, and could marry surely a pretty girl of
his own age.”</p>

<p>Jane and Nancy Holcomb were sisters, well-to-do
in the world, very necessary to each
other, but not especially necessary to the rest
of the community. Nancy was half an invalid,
who repaid the care of her sister with a nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
perfect affection. She would have made a
lovely wife had she been married some years
before.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Jane had never married.
Her continual worry lest a particle of dust
adhere to table or chair, her constant picking
up of book, or shawl, or gloves, if anything
were left for a moment out of place,
would have made her an annoyance to any man
who wished to enjoy his home. If a picture
had been painted of Jane Holcomb, it would
not have been complete without a broom in
her hand. There was one good servant in the
house who kept things reasonably neat, but
Jane was forever cleaning. If she had married,
and had been the mother of children, probably
she would have been less fussy, and a pleasanter
woman to live with.</p>

<p>Both women idolized the bright nephew,
Justus, who loved his aunts in the abstract,
but usually kept as far away from Aunt Jane’s
broom as possible.</p>

<p>He was a handsome young fellow, cheery,
cordial, earnest, sympathetic, and withal possessed
of excellent common-sense. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
just graduated from a medical school, and was
coming home for a visit to the aunts. Jane
swept and dusted more than ever, till the
carpets and furniture would have protested, if
that were possible. Nancy grew fresher and
better in health from the expected arrival.</p>

<p>Finally the young man came, and was kissed
and petted as young men are apt to be by
women older than themselves. Aunt Jane
looked him over from head to foot. Yes, he
was clean and attractive, even to her practised
eye.</p>

<p>“Now, Justus,” she said, as they were sitting
by the open fire after supper, “tell your aunts
about the love matter which we hear of. I
think this lady is a little older than you.” Jane
controlled herself and became diplomatic, because
a young man cannot usually be driven,
but must be gently led.</p>

<p>“If you mean Miss Watterson&mdash;yes, she is a
charming woman. She is thirty-five, just ten
years older than I. I confess she attracts me
more than any of the girls of my own age. She
is not handsome, but very intelligent, has read
widely, and is a noble woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you surely would be the subject of
much remark in society if you married her.
And we are so proud of you, Justus, we naturally
wish you could marry rich, and some one
who could help you in your profession. You
know a woman can help to make her husband
popular or unpopular.”</p>

<p>“I know it, aunt; but, after all, I need the
right kind of companionship when I marry. I
have not decided the matter yet, and perhaps I
shall grow wiser.”</p>

<p>“You must not forget also, Justus, that as a
rule a woman grows old faster than a man, or
she used to. I cannot say that she does exactly
in this new age, when American men are killing
themselves in business, and the women are living
in luxury. But when you are forty-five
and in your prime, your wife will be fifty-five;
and the disparity will be more apparent then
than now. Besides, you will see so many attractive
faces in your profession.”</p>

<p>“That would not influence me, Aunt Jane.
If I loved her once, I should hope to be man
enough to love her always. But I will wait
awhile before I”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is right,” said Nancy; “you know we
shall make you our heir, that is, sister Jane will,
and we want you to be a leader socially and in
your profession. You know men have such a
wide sphere of influence. All our lives centre
in you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t build too much upon my future, Aunt
Nancy, though I will do my best.”</p>

<p>“Do you correspond with Miss Watterson?”
said Jane half hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“We have done so, but we have discontinued
it, as I am sure she thinks the difference in our
ages a possible obstacle to our future happiness.”</p>

<p>“Well, she is a wise woman not to let a boy
be captured even in accord with his own wishes.
Why it is that young men so often like older
women I’m sure I can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Because they are natural and not simpering,
feel an interest and dare to show it, are
vivacious without flippancy, and usually well-enough
read to be companionable to an educated
man. You know, Aunt Jane, a man
doesn’t want simply a pretty face to look on
forever. He must have something besides a
vine nowadays.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, tell us about Miss Watterson?”</p>

<p>“She has travelled abroad, plays delightfully,
loves to do charitable work, has tact enough to
know when to talk and when to be silent, likes
to look well, but does not spend all her time in
dress as do some whom I know, whether their
fathers can afford it or not, and doesn’t seem to
make any especial effort to win my affections,
but is thoroughly appreciative.”</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t she married before this? Been
in love and been disappointed, I warrant.”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know. She has never told
me. I suppose, like yourself, Aunt Jane, she
hasn’t found a man good enough.”</p>

<p>Jane Holcomb smiled in a pleased kind of
way at this delicate allusion to her superior
judgment.</p>

<p>“Well, Justus, I wish you would promise me
that you won’t write to Miss Watterson for one
year, and by that time you will probably have
found some one more suitable to your age.”</p>

<p>“I promise, but I shall be so busy with my
profession that I fear no other lady will command
my time.”</p>

<p>When Justus departed Jane kissed him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
not only maternal fondness, but with that
woman’s pride that feels she has for once circumvented
an attractive woman, doubtless in
love with a bright and handsome nephew.</p>

<p>“One year will fix matters,” she said to
Nancy, after Justus had gone. “Few loves can
bear such a silence as that.”</p>

<p>“I fear Justus will be lonesome,” said Nancy,
who still had a little longing in her heart that
the youth might have the woman of his choice,
even though “unsuitable,” as Jane had said.
There was a touch of romance in Nancy that
would have made her an interesting woman if
circumstances had been permitted to develop
her.</p>

<p>Long letters came from Justus. He was
busy and successful. Jane was happy, but
Nancy thought she detected a depressed feeling
in the letters. He was lonely, of course. Who
can enjoy the companionship of a cultivated
and womanly woman and not miss it? Who
that has had one sincere affection, especially if
it have something of reverence in it, can readily
supply its place with another?</p>

<p>One morning, after a year had passed, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
square envelope came, and a full, kind, but decided
letter. It contained cards announcing
the marriage of Justus Holcomb and Miss
Watterson. What society would say, what even
his good aunts would say, had been weighed in
the balance and been found wanting.</p>

<p>Jane was sadly disappointed. “Another instance
of a woman’s power,” she said. “I never
knew a woman that couldn’t do what she set
out to do, if a man’s heart were at stake. I
feared it all the while. Men will do such foolish
things. I fear Justus will regret, but he is
so manly he will never say so.”</p>

<p>“But she may be better for him than a fly-away-girl,”
Nancy suggested. “I hope it will
turn out well. We must be kind to them and
write them to come to see us.”</p>

<p>Jane set the house in order, and swept and
dusted, and made herself ready for the inevitable.
When the visit was made and Justus was
found to be happy with a wife ten years his
senior, Jane was in a measure reconciled. “It
could have been worse,” she said to Nancy.
“She seems a very clever person.”</p>

<p>“I like her,” said Nancy; “she has a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sweet smile, and this makes even a plain face
attractive. I don’t believe she tried to get him,
for he seems more in love than she does.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s a woman’s skill in covering,”
said Jane. “But men will be foolish, I suppose,
till the end of the world.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">PLAYING WITH HEARTS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap07 p2">SEVERAL instances, showing the results of
playing with hearts, have come under my
notice, which have emphasized in my mind the
danger of being careless in such matters.</p>

<p>That it is natural for young men to admire
and love young women goes without saying.
As well argue that we must not love flowers
and music and sunlight, as to say one must not
love the beauty and grace and sweetness of
young womanhood.</p>

<p>A home to many if not most young men
means all that is restful and delightful; a place
for comfort after the toil of the day; a place of
companionship with some one whose interests
are identical with his, and whose tastes are congenial
to his own. He does not wait, as does a
woman, to see if love be reciprocal. He loves,
and hopes for and asks for a return.</p>

<p>The girl is apt to be less impulsive. She, or
her mother for her, is perhaps worldly wise,
and considers well whether the man can support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
her, and whether he will probably make
her happy. She accepts the attentions of one
or a dozen, and decides among them. This is
right according to our modern society, but she
too often forgets whether she is giving pain
needlessly.</p>

<p>It is too much the fashion to argue that men
are not deeply touched in such matters; that,
full of business as they are, a refusal is easily
borne, and another love takes the place.</p>

<p>True, we read in the daily press quite often
of a suicide resulting from a rebuff or a broken
promise, but we seem to forget, unless perchance
it touches our own home circle, and
then the mother’s heart breaks for her tenderly
reared son or daughter.</p>

<p>I believe the history of the world shows that
men love deeply, and with an affection as lasting
as that of women. Who can ever forget
the undying affection of Sir Walter Scott for
fair young Margaret? He met and loved her
at nineteen, and for six years worked at his law
drudgery, looking forward to a happy union
with her. He said to a friend, “It was a proud
night with me when I first found that a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
young woman could think it worth while to sit
and talk with me hour after hour, in a corner of
the ball-room, while all the world were capering
in our view.”</p>

<p>As his first year’s practice brought him but
$125, his second $290, and his third $420,
the young lady counselled waiting for better
days.</p>

<p>Two years later Margaret was married to the
eldest son of a baronet, afterward Sir William
Forbes, and died thirteen years after her marriage.
The cause of her change of mind is
not known.</p>

<p>At first Scott felt that he had been wronged,
but this feeling against Margaret soon subsided,
and was replaced by an unchangeable
affection. She became the heroine of
“Rokeby” and of “Woodstock.”</p>

<p>Thirty years later, when Europe and
America were filled with praise of Scott, he
met the mother of his early love. He writes
in his diary, after the meeting:</p>

<p>“I went to make a visit, and fairly softened
myself like an old fool, with recalling old
stories till I was fit for nothing but shedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
tears and repeating verses for the whole night.
This is sad work. The very grave gives up
its dead, and time rolls back thirty years to
add to my perplexities. I don’t care. I
begin to grow case-hardened, and, like a stag
turning at bay, my naturally good temper
grows fierce and dangerous. Yet what a
romance to tell, and told, I fear, it will one
day be. And then my three years of dreaming
and my two years of awakening will be
chronicled, doubtless. But the dead will feel
no pain.”</p>

<p>When he visited St. Andrews he recalled
how thirty-four years before he had carved
her name in runic characters on the turf beside
the castle gate, and asked himself why, at fifty-six,
that name “should still agitate his heart.”</p>

<p>I never read of stern and fearless Andrew
Jackson without recalling his devoted love for
Rachel Robards. With the world he was
thought to be domineering and harsh, and was
often profane; but with her he was patient,
gentle, and deferential. Having no children,
they adopted her nephew when but a few days
old. When Jackson conquered at New Orleans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and young ladies strewed flowers along the
path of the hero, to have the commendation
of Rachel was more than that of all the world
beside. When he was elected President she
said, “Well, for Mr. Jackson’s sake I am glad;
for my own part I never wished it.”</p>

<p>Earnest in her religious convictions, he built
a small brick church for her in the Hermitage
grounds, that she might gather her neighbors
and servants about her for worship. Mrs.
Jackson died suddenly just after her husband’s
election to the presidency. He could not
believe that she was dead. When they
brought a table to lay her body upon, “Spread four
blankets upon it. If she does come to, she
will lie so hard upon the table.”</p>

<p>All night long he sat beside the form of his
beloved Rachel, often feeling of her heart and
pulse. In the morning he was wholly inconsolable,
and when he found that she was really
dead the body could scarcely be forced from
his arms. He prepared a tomb for her like an
open summer-house, and buried her under the
white dome supported by marble pillars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>While Jackson lived he wore her miniature
constantly about his neck, and every night laid
it open beside her prayer-book at his bedside.
Her face was the last thing upon which his eyes
rested before he slept, and the first thing upon
which his eyes opened in the morning, through
those eight years at the White House. He
made his will bequeathing all his property to
his adopted son, because, said he, “If she were
alive she would wish him to have it all, and to
me her wish is law.”</p>

<p>Two days before he died he said, “Heaven
will be no heaven to me if I do not find my
wife there.” He used to say, “All I have
achieved&mdash;fame, power, everything&mdash;would I
exchange, if she could be restored to me for a
moment.”</p>

<p>Washington Irving cherished forever the
memory of Matilda Hoffman, who died at the
age of seventeen. He could never hear her
name mentioned afterward. After his death a
package was found marked “Private Mems.”
In a faded manuscript of his own writing were
a lovely miniature of Matilda and a braid of
fair hair. For years Irving kept her Bible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
prayer-book under his pillow, and to the end
of his life these were always carried with him
on his journeys.</p>

<p>In the faded manuscript one reads:</p>

<p>“The ills that I have undergone in this life
have been dealt out to me drop by drop, and I
have tasted all their bitterness. I saw her fade
rapidly away: beautiful and more beautiful,
and most angelical to the last.</p>

<p>“I seemed to care for nothing; the world was
a blank to me. I abandoned all thought of the
law. I went into the country, but could not
bear the solitude, yet could not endure society....
I seemed to drift about without aim or
object, at the mercy of every breeze; my heart
wanted anchorage. I was naturally susceptible,
and tried to form other attachments, but my
heart would not hold on; it would continually
recur to what it had lost; and whenever there
was a pause in the hurry of novelty and excitement
I would sink into dismal dejection. For
years I could not talk on the subject of this
hopeless regret; I could not even mention her
name; but her image was continually before
me, and I dreamed of her incessantly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppn8q p1">“For time makes all but true love old;<br />
The burning thoughts that then were told<br />
Run molten still in memory’s mould,<br />
And will not cool<br />
Until the heart itself is cold<br />
In Lethe’s pool.”</p>

<p class="p1">The memory of Ann Rutledge never faded
from the heart of Abraham Lincoln. Years
after her death he was heard to say, “My heart
lies buried in the grave of that girl. I can
never be reconciled to have the snow, rains,
and storms beat upon her grave.”</p>

<p>Gruff Samuel Johnson worked in his garret,
a most inconvenient room, after his “Tetty”
died, because, said he, “In that room I never
saw Mrs. Johnson.” Her wedding-ring was
placed in a little box, and tenderly kept till his
death.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo’s devotion to Vittoria Colonna
will be told, perhaps, even after the wonderful
statues of Day and Night are lost or
destroyed. “He bore such a love to her,”
said his pupil Condivi “that I remember to
have heard him say that he grieved at nothing
so much as that when he went to see her pass
from this life he had not kissed her brow or her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
face, as he kissed her hand. After her death he
frequently stood trembling and as if insensible.”</p>

<p>All lovers of art know of Saskia, whose life
was to Rembrandt like the transcendent light
he threw over his pictures; whose death left
him forever in the shadow of shadows.</p>

<p>If men give such affection as these men gave,&mdash;and
tens of thousands do,&mdash;then the affection
is worth the most careful consideration;
accepted, if possible, with gratitude that one
has been thought worthy of homage; refused,
if necessary, with the utmost delicacy and
kindness.</p>

<p>Young women sometimes, perhaps because
of youth, do not realize the far-reaching influence
of what the world is pleased to jest
about as “love affairs.”</p>

<p>An acquaintance of mine, pretty, intelligent,
and reared by a Christian mother, became
engaged to two young men at the same time.
One of course was refused, with, to him, bitter
heartache. She married the other, led a
wretched life with him, and finally was divorced.</p>

<p>Another received for years the attention of
a worthy and wealthy young man. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
young man visited her, for whom she possibly
had a preference. Both offered themselves to
her, and both were accepted, she doubtless
hoping to choose later the one who pleased
her best. Both discovered her plan, were indignant,
and left her to make other conquests.</p>

<p>These cases are far from isolated. I do not
believe they arise from the heartlessness of
women, but from lack of thought and care. A
man can offer a woman nothing higher than a
sincere love. While she need not assume that
men who offer her attention wish to marry her,
it is a mistake to keep one’s eyes shut, and
open them only to find that a heart has been
hurt temporarily, and perchance permanently.
Good common-sense as well as principle are
necessary in matters pertaining to hearts.</p>

<h2 class="p4">DUTY.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">“JAMES, I hear you are getting interested
in Martha Wenham!” said good old
Mrs. Matthews, tremblingly, to her only son,
as they sat by the fire one evening after he
had returned from a hard day’s work.</p>

<p>He had been her only support for four years,
ever since her kind husband died. His sister
Nellie, sweet but fragile, had leaned upon his
strong arm for help, for she was unable to
support herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clayton, a neighbor, had been over
telling James’s mother what she had heard
about the young people: that they had been
seen to walk very leisurely home from singing-schools
and prayer-meetings, and that, at the
last church picnic, he and Martha, regardless
of all the others, had sauntered off to a cool,
cosey nook, and were seemingly very happy
and very much absorbed, as people are wont
to be under such circumstances. Martha was
a very excellent girl, the daughter of a well-to-do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
village merchant, would make one of the
best of wives, and James would be fortunate to
win her; but poor Mrs. Matthews saw herself
and Nellie cast upon the world, for in case
James married he could no more than support
his wife and the little ones that would probably
be born to them. He had been a faithful
son, leaving school and books that he
loved, to work with his hands and earn his
bread. He had been able to pay their rent,
get them a few neat clothes, and buy all necessary
food.</p>

<p>Sometimes he seemed rather quiet, as though
he longed again for the school days, that he
might realize his ambition to be a prominent
man in the world. When either mother or
daughter caught a glimpse of any such feelings,
they tried to make the home pleasanter
for him. Mrs. Matthews baked things he liked,
and Nellie took a little picture from her scantily
furnished room to hang in his, or gathered
a few flowers for his table.</p>

<p>No wonder the dependent mother spoke
anxiously about his interest in Martha Wenham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I like her very much, mother. I
think she is the noblest girl I ever saw!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Matthews trembled more and more.
She wanted to ask him if he ever thought of
marrying her, but she could not.</p>

<p>Finally, after long silence, James said, as
though he had been weighing the thing in his
own mind, “Do you think she would make me
a good wife, mother?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I think she might, James, but what
would your poor mother do?” and the tears
gathered in her eyes. “I’m afraid I’m a
burden, James! Don’t you wish there were
no obstacles in the way? Oh, James, I wonder
God arranged it so!” and the fond mother
could have longed to be out of the way, that
her boy’s happiness might be completed.</p>

<p>James Matthews’s big heart was full. He
had never thought of leaving his mother, and,
though he loved Martha, duty was first with
him always; so he put his hard hands upon his
mother’s gray head and kissed her, bidding
her not to fear; that he should never leave her,
and that she was better than all the Marthas
in the world, and as for Nellie, he’d work his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
fingers off for her before any other girl should
take her place.</p>

<p>That night there was a timid knock at
Martha’s door, and James Matthews was cordially
welcomed. Several times before all the
commonplaces were talked of he tried to tell
her his errand in coming, but his courage as
often failed. Martha broke the ice for him
when she said, “I think, James, that day spent
at the picnic was the pleasantest of my life.”
What could be more delightful than to hear
from her own lips the very confession he had
longed to hear&mdash;that his presence was a
pleasure to her, that she perhaps in some
measure returned his affection?</p>

<p>“It was a very happy one to me,” responded
James. “I have often wondered if it gave
you pleasure. Martha, perhaps you do not
know that I have loved you for a long time,
and perhaps it is wrong for me to tell you of
it, seeing that I cannot marry anybody.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” said Martha, a blush
spreading over her fair face and losing itself
in her golden hair.</p>

<p>“Because my mother and sister are dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
upon me, and as long as they live&mdash;and I
hope it may be many years&mdash;I shall take care
of them. I could love you always without marriage,
but that is the only bond that can keep
you mine alone and forever. Others will be
seeking one so good as you are. I could not
ask you to be engaged, for you might wait for
years before I was able to support a third in
our home, and support you as nicely as I
should wish to do. You have had too many
comforts to receive poverty at my hands.”</p>

<p>“You know I am young, James, only seventeen,
and I can wait a great many years for
you. I love you very much, and I have a good
home to wait in; so what matter, so long as we
are near each other? I’ll wait until I’m an
old lady, James, if need be.”</p>

<p>The noble girl had answered as her pure
heart had prompted.</p>

<p>Many a man knows how rich, and happy,
and satisfied James Matthews felt that night
as he came home in the moonlight. How
strong his arms felt for work, and how strong
his good principles seemed!</p>

<p>He could do anything now for mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
sister&mdash;make any sacrifice; for did not one wait
for him whose encouragement was more than
money, to live with whom for one year even
would recompense for a score of years of labor?</p>

<p>Mrs. Matthews and Nellie grew happier as
they saw him so cheerful, and as his wages increased
with his larger experience, and more of
the comforts of life were obtained, Nellie, with
less anxiety and more ease, grew better.</p>

<p>Two years had passed, and changes had
come to Martha Wenham. Her father was
dead, his property gone, and her health impaired
by long and weary care of him. What
was left for her but to claim the hand of him
for whom she had waited these two years?
Refusing all others, she had been true to him.
Now came the time of trial to both.</p>

<p>Martha was helpless, and had nowhere to
look but to him. His heart clung to her now
more than ever, but who could support the
two who seemed to be left providentially on his
hands? Many an evening he passed with her,
feeling every time as though the day of parting,
if it must come to that, would be unbearable;
finally he resolved to marry her, take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
her to his home, and do all in his power for the
three. It could be only a scanty subsistence
he could earn for them, and by taking another
upon himself, would he not spoil the happiness
of them all? He might have but one meal
a day for himself, and he was willing; but
what poor reward for the girl who had lost
so many good places in life to share penury
with him!</p>

<p>“James, I have a plan to propose to you,
though you may not second it, and indeed I do
not know if it be right or best,” said Martha to
him one night. “William Stillson, you know,
has loved me from the time we were children
together, and has always been a warm friend to
me, even after I refused him. In these days of
anxiety and prospective want, he has offered
me again himself and his lovely home. I respect
him, James, but you have my heart
and he knows it. All rests with you. Shall I
marry him, and thus free you from what must
necessarily be a burden?”</p>

<p>James could not answer, and when she put
her cheek upon his and held his hand, he said,
“Oh, Martha, I cannot give you up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“My will is yours,” she said, and kissed him
good-night.</p>

<p>It troubled him after he came home. She
might be so comfortable with William, so
cramped with him. His duty was plain before
him. He took a pen and paper and hastily
wrote:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">My Martha</span>: I release you! I know what is
best for you! Marry William and be happy. There is
no other course. I shall be happy because you are.
My blessing go with you.</p>

<p class="pr8">Your</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">James</span>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Four weeks after, Martha, a woman through
her sufferings, and true to her womanhood in
acting honestly, gave her hand to William Stillson,
promising to be his faithful wife. James
heard the words that separated them forever,
and seemed to grow stronger for his duties at
home. He never visited her, but when she
bore a beautiful boy to her husband, he felt
that he might love the child, and this wee one
became his plaything for many a month, until
they moved to a distant part of the country.
Then, for the first time, though he missed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
boy and the sweet face of the mother, he was
no longer under restraint. He could have her
in his thoughts better than in his sight.</p>

<p>Many a year went by quietly, even happily,
to James, for we find our highest happiness in
doing our daily duties. He had earned his
mother and sister a lovely home, which is much
for any man single handed to do; was respected
in the community, well read through his industry
and perseverance, and a genial and good-principled
citizen.</p>

<p>Nellie had married a widower with several
motherless children, and she was doing for
others what had been done for her. Then the
good mother, when her time was fully come,
died and was buried, and James was left alone.</p>

<p>Everybody supposed he would marry now;
wondered why he was a bachelor! All the
married ladies pitied him for their daughters’
sakes, and ladies of uncertain ages looked wistfully
in his direction. An old lady kept his
house neatly, while in books and memories and
social converse his days went by rapidly.</p>

<p>One morning the house went through an
extra cleaning and arranging. An old schoolfriend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a bachelor like himself, was coming to
spend several days with him, and the good
housekeeper, a spinster herself, but old enough
to be the mother of both of them, could not
help feeling a little tremulousness with regard
to the new-comer. James secretly felt more
than ordinary interest in his coming, from the
fact that Mrs. Stillson lived in the same place.</p>

<p>“I believe I have a friend in your vicinity,”
said James to his friend the first evening, at the
supper table.</p>

<p>“Ah! I suppose some flame&mdash;a maiden
lady about your age, probably.”</p>

<p>“No. A Mrs. Stillson I refer to. We were
very excellent friends when we were young.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I know her very well. Have
done considerable law business for her since
her husband’s death. She has four children
and in quite straitened circumstances.”</p>

<p>James Matthews felt a sudden increase of circulation
about his heart.</p>

<p>She was free to wed him now, if she would,
he thought to himself. Now he could be a
father to those children, and do for them all he
had longed to do for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>When the lawyer went home, much to his
surprise Mr. Matthews accompanied him.</p>

<p>The knock at Mrs. Stillson’s door was answered
by a bright, noble-looking boy of eighteen.
The mother, with the same sweet face as
in her girlhood, was called in.</p>

<p>“Oh, James!” she said, and the tears gathered
in her eyes. “I am so glad to see you
once more!”</p>

<p>Perhaps she thought he held her hand too
long and earnestly for a man who probably
had a wife and children at home.</p>

<p>“I have thought,” she added, “if I could
only see you in our present circumstances, you
might be induced to take our youngest, a boy
of six, and adopt him as your own.”</p>

<p>“Martha, may I take the boy, and take his
mother with him?” said James Matthews, his
heart almost too full for utterance.</p>

<p>The cheek was laid to his as in other days,
and the old answer given, “Your will, James, is
mine!”</p>

<p>He was satisfied now, with a happiness
interwoven with it that none knew, except
those who have waited long and been rewarded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
The old housekeeper felt a little unpleasantly
when a lady and four children were so suddenly
added to their family, but soon recovered her
equilibrium, and did everything for their comfort,
living with them until she died.</p>

<p>There was considerable gossip for a time.
Everybody knew now why he had not married
earlier. The maiden ladies were quiet, the married
ladies very polite, and James and Martha
very happy in themselves and in their children.</p>

<h2 class="p4">WAIFY.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">“HEAVENS, a baby! Who brought such
a speck of humanity to lay at my cold
door? There is no love in my heart. The
thing will die with me. I’ll tuck it down in
the corner of the cave for to-night.”</p>

<p>Giles Mortimer laid the bundle on a rough
pine table, put the candle close beside it,
and one by one took off the garments folded
about it&mdash;took them off with the same care
and fear of touch as a naturalist in preparing
the wings or feet of a fly for microscopic
examination. He half raised it in his arms,
then laid it down, walked around the cavern
with a vague knowledge of a near presence,
came back, took it up slowly and held it by
the firelight.</p>

<p>It had a delicate girl-face, with half-quivering
lips, and a little body perfect in proportions.
Who was she? Some mother must
have cared for her as long as strength or life
lasted, for she was now fully ten months old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
What should he do with the little waif? This
triangular cave was his home. The green
turf above it shut out scorching sun and
chilling snow; the rude door before its opening
made it seem secure from danger; the
mortar he had put about the sides, the tall
prairie grass he had matted over the ground
floor, the old stove he had brought thither,
the rustic chair he had made from the surrounding
forests, and the Indian blankets he
had bought for his bed, all made it comfortable,
though gloomy.</p>

<p>Such a place might suffice for him, but how
could an infant grow into grace and beauty
here, leaning ever towards the light of the
outer world, and longing for love that must be
the elixir of life to woman?</p>

<p>The lips that before quivered with fear now
opened with hunger. He laid her down, went
out to a log box adjoining the cave, coaxed
his goat to a fresh supply of milk, and the
babe drank from his hand, nestled her head
against his breast, and slept. She was not
tucked away in a corner, but rested next his
heart through that long night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Giles Mortimer was written fatherless and
motherless in boyhood. A pleasant home
was sold, a small sum of money laid away,
and a youth just needing a father’s care and
mother’s affection was thrust upon the charities
of the world. He soon found employment
in a factory, and there, day by day, when
others walked and laughed upon the highway,
he worked and looked beyond to a successful
future, saved his money carefully, dressed
simply, and in a few years had nearly enough
to defray the expenses of three years’ study.
College days followed. Those four years
brought head and hand work to Mortimer.
By forethought and exertion he gained the
privilege of sweeping the college chapel, took
the agency of books and pictures in vacation,
and in numerous other ways partially paid for
his education. His companions loved him for
his geniality, and admired him for his broad
grasp of mind and manly soul.</p>

<p>Life looked full of promise. Towards what
should it tend? The professions were full.
Among those who held out the gospel of life
to the famishing, there were too many whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Christ had never called with His especial calling.
There were lawyers at every corner
quarrelling for a petty office, or looking over
dusty books while sighing for the bright skies.
There were teachers who needed to be taught.
Chemistry, geology, and philosophy had so
many votaries that only one in a century rose
to eminence, and the remainder, in unsatisfying
mediocrity, plodded on with little happiness
to themselves and still less to others.</p>

<p>He turned to business. Here was an opening
to gain honorable power by effort of will,
by energy of hand, and by vigor of mind.
There was beauty to him in the smoke that
curled now lazily, now swiftly, from the chimneys
of a hundred manufactories. If he could
not be a merchant prince to give with blessed
munificence one hundred thousand dollars for
homes for the poor, he might have a home for
some one who loved him, and many mites to
scatter in the alleys of the great cities.</p>

<p>With Giles Mortimer’s man-physique and
mind there was a woman’s sensitiveness, and
a will that could not always bear the shock
of opposition. A mountain is not all quartz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
studded with jasper and amethyst, nor is it all
trap, brown and coarse. All lives are elements
from God’s great storehouse, and earth a crucible
which melts and moulds. He needed what
most men need, the stimulus of love to give
position or wealth or fame; the encouragement
of a voice that has inspiration in it; the touch
of a hand that carries hope in its pressure; the
look of an eye that shines like a lone star on a
dark night. He had seen some who might
have walked beside him, but for his fear of
taking them from a hall to a hovel.</p>

<p>He went to a strange city. Counting-rooms
were filled, and clerkships engaged for months
in advance. He knew no trade, or he might
have worked and given honor to that. At last
he obtained a place in a hardware establishment,
and for two years, on a small salary, the
student did uncongenial work to live; then the
firm failed, and he was again adrift. He would
have loved manufacturing; he would have been
proud to have aided America with the labor of
his brain and hands combined; but the old
question, the one that has settled upon and
crushed so many young men, came back&mdash;“What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
business can be carried on without
money?”</p>

<p>Many men have struggled through poverty
up to affluence. Many more have struggled in
it down to a grave. There are not wanting
those who tell us that every man may succeed,
if he will; and yet ninety of every hundred who
enter the whirlpool of trade are lost.</p>

<p>Like many others, when his heart was saddest
he sang&mdash;sang like Carligny, who was dying
when he made Paris intoxicated with his wit.
No publisher was obtained for his poems; he
had not found that spring that opens all portals&mdash;a
name. Every house was already filled with
manuscripts, every journal with hastily-written
fragments. A living earned by writing was one
that too often gave straw for a bed, and bread
and water for food. He was growing tired of
the battle. There were no victories&mdash;all
defeats. Perhaps he lacked proper training of
self; perhaps the now weakened physical had
dimmed the mental; perhaps circumstances
without were as strong as the powers within.
Men were no longer brothers to him. He
sighed for the freedom of solitude, stepped one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
evening on a freight train going West, and,
careless for the future, went forward to an
unknown fate. He crossed foaming Lake
Erie; flat, woody Michigan and its lake;
passed through Milwaukee with its forests and
few inhabitants, where now rises one of the
loveliest cities of the West, out into the uncivilized
country. The land was rolling, with here
and there a prairie shut in by a border of oak
or cotton-wood trees. The lakes&mdash;long Pewaukee;
graceful Pine; clear Kotchee, that makes
the highway an arch and circles under it; and
Neponset, with green, scalloped bank and a
tree in each scallop reflected by the waters&mdash;all
these were like oases to him.</p>

<p>He reached the Indian village, Oconomowoc,
and stood at the foot of the peninsula that
almost touches the island. On one side was a
lake bordered with hawthorn, on whose bank
a neat church now stands; on the other, five
lakes, some small, one seventeen miles in
length, surrounding islands covered with spruce
and hemlock and oak. Hills, with their outcropping
quarries of limestone, stood out
against the blue sky. Back of this landscape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
one of the most beautiful of the West, he found
a cave worn into the mountain&mdash;a gloomy
place, but free from dampness, and comfortable
for one who had no care for humanity.</p>

<p>Occasionally he made friends with an Indian
and asked him to his hut, but this was rare.
They looked upon him as a pale-face who,
having vexed the Great Spirit, was repenting in
solitude. He spent his days in wandering and
study. He learned the geological history of
the place from the hieroglyphics God puts
upon the rocks for man to read. He pressed
hundreds of flowers, and knew what Jehovah
had intended for the gardens of the growing
West. He wrote some, and grew happy in his
isolated existence; yet there was no flow of
animal life within him, no leaping of the heart
for joy. The past was a sealed book; the
present written with the indifference of a stoic;
and the future a blank leaf with no desire to
write upon it.</p>

<p>Such was Giles Mortimer when a tender
child was laid before him&mdash;a magnet to draw
out a heart.</p>

<p>He called her Waify. For days and weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
he dressed her, washed her delicate clothes with
his own hands, fed her, and made a wagon of
rough boards and drew her to the lakes, that
she might dabble her hands and feet in the
clear waters. Soon the baby lips, as if taught
by angels, said “Papa!” and the man’s affections
swept back upon him as a flood. He
kissed her again and again, and she, all unconscious
of the reason, put her fingers in his hair
and beard, and laughed with that merry laugh
that makes most homes, even in their decay,
full of the echoes of childhood. A new look
was born into his face, a look of manly protection,
as though a soul was given to his
charge.</p>

<p>Six months came and went. Little feet
strolled outside the walls. She seemed to look
vainly for something to play with, gathered
blades of grass and flowers in her creeping,
and showed a longing for a fuller life. Mortimer
saw it, aroused his sleeping ambition, put
out the fire in the old cave, put Waify into the
wagon, with a blanket about her that he might
keep in memory the first night she slept under
it, tossed his half dozen books and small bundle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of clothes at her feet, and started for the city.
Kind people gave them a shelter at night, and
Waify made friends everywhere.</p>

<p>To the home of a lady he had known among
the early settlers of Milwaukee he carried his
precious charge, and started this time for business
with a strength and energy that knew no
failure. There were some struggles, but at
length a place was found with a land-broker.
The city was growing rapidly. Small pieces
of land were purchased as by economy some
money was saved.</p>

<p>After many months of labor a small house
was hired, a pretty play-room arranged for the
wee Waify, a good servant obtained, and Giles
Mortimer was a happy man. No longer hating
the world or its people, but having grown
strong from obstacles overcome, he had sympathy
for others and a genial look and manner
that gave him the fascination of a woman.</p>

<p>Every night Waify came a little way to meet
him. Then by the firelight he told her cheery
stories, made rabbits for her on the wall, and
with her on his knees thanked God for something
human to love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>School life began. A tiny primer was purchased,
and Mortimer, more the man than ever,
taught her the alphabet. “A” she remembered
from two rivers and a brook across. “B” was a
river with two little crooked ones, and “C” stood
for the cave. Every summer since they lived
in the city he had taken her thither and showed
her where she used to live.</p>

<p>“Here is the place where you were, Waify;
here the table where I put my baby; here the
old stove where I warmed your milk; here the
green grass where you played.”</p>

<p>“Pretty! pretty!” said Waify. “Kind papa
to take care of me! Papa, when Waify dies
will you bury her here among the flowers, and
make a big ‘C,’ for cave, on the stone?”</p>

<p>A hurried kiss was the answer, while a shock
that seemed like a premonition struck every
nerve.</p>

<p>“Will you, papa? Will you?” pleaded the
child. “Right here where the double daisies
grow?”</p>

<p>“The garden will be gone, Waify.”</p>

<p>“But won’t you keep it for me, and bring
me here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, darling. Yes, little one!” and they
went home, the one light-hearted with the
prospect of school again, the other saddened
with a thought that seemed a prophecy.</p>

<p>A few days of joyous life went by. The little
school-girl seemed less fond of play, more clinging
to her adopted father, more thoughtful;
then a slow fever, that seemed to have been
inherited rather than the result of contagion,
came on, and Waify, now scarcely out of her
babyhood, was going to sleep through a long
night.</p>

<p>Giles Mortimer watched her by day and by
night, speechless; brought the toys she loved,
and laid them beside her; brought the blocks
of letters, and she took the “C” and put it
under her pillow.</p>

<p>“Papa, we’ve had nice times together.
Who’ll be your little girl when Waify goes?
Everybody has little girls. Perhaps somebody’ll
bring you one.”</p>

<p>While he blessed God that she had been
given to make him the man he was, he asked
for no other in her place.</p>

<p>“But you must stay, Waify. I couldn’t be
happy without you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, papa, I must go to ask God about my
mamma, and perhaps I’ll come back and tell
you.”</p>

<p>How little do children know of the land from
whence there is no return!</p>

<p>The day looked for, dreaded, came.</p>

<p>“Where’s the ‘C,’ papa?”</p>

<p>Clasping this tightly with one hand and
Mortimer’s with the other, looking sadly at the
tears upon his cheeks, then joyfully out into
the space, she said, “Kiss Waify!” and was
dead.</p>

<p>Giles Mortimer’s heart was mangled. The
only thing he loved was taken.</p>

<p>There was a quiet gathering, and then he,
with the sexton, took the little one to the cave,
dug a grave under the daisies in the very centre
of the garden, put a little tablet above it, and
upon it the large marble “C” that stood for cave,
and went back to his duties to work faithfully
because her memory was something like her
presence. The house was desolate, but sacred
because Waify had been there. Business was
interesting because entered upon for her; life
was blessed because she had lived. Prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
came to him. He loved other children, but
there was only one Waify.</p>

<p>She had done her work. Through her love
a man had known and found his manhood&mdash;had
taken his true place in the world, in genial
intercourse, in business power, in Christian
benevolence. He has grown in position with
the growth of a large city, but he still calls it
home where a heart is buried, by the cave in
Oconomowoc.</p>

<p>Perchance God told Waify of her mother, or
told the mother of her child, for, weeks after her
death, Giles Mortimer found upon the grave a
touching token of a mother’s love&mdash;a wreath of
immortelles wrought into the word “Mother.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE BLACK AND TAN.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">MRS. HENSON sat with her three children
at their frugal supper. The house
was neat, but very plain, and the dress of the
children showed that they were only a trifle
above actual want.</p>

<p>James, a boy of ten, sold newspapers and
earned a little. Helen, between eight and
nine, could help about the house when her
mother was absent cleaning or washing, and
Mary, seven, was the baby of the household,
and the one for whom all the others sacrificed.</p>

<p>“Did you earn much this week, James?”
said the mother, who had been a widow for
several years. “You know I have been sick,
and we can’t meet the rent this month, and
we didn’t last month. I don’t know what
we shall do,” said Mrs. Henson, in a tone of
confidence with James, although she did not
expect that her three small children could help
her solve the problem. She knew that work
alone would solve it, and this she was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
always able to obtain, and had been too ill to
labor even if the work were before her.</p>

<p>“I tried hard,” said the brown-eyed, slender
boy, “but I didn’t sell as many papers as I
do sometimes. I ran just as fast, but somehow
I didn’t get so many customers, and
there weren’t so many extras. You know a
lady once in a while slips a nickel into your
hand for a paper and won’t wait for change,
and that helps a fellow along. But I didn’t
have much of that last week. I didn’t spend
anything for myself, either.”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t do that. We all save
for each other since father died. We shall
get over these hard places when you are a
little older.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you borrow of the lady on the
hill who gave me the shoes?” said Helen.
“She seems very nice, and she is rich.”</p>

<p>“She has been good to us,” said the mother,
“but I hate to bother her. One can wear out
generous people by too constant asking for
aid.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what to do, mamma,” said
little Mary; “we’ll sell the black and tan to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the big gentleman who always speaks to me
so kind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said all the other voices together.
“Blackie was given to you, and you have
played with her, and we couldn’t spare her.
She eats very little, and you love her very
much. She is the life of the house, she is
so frolicsome.”</p>

<p>“But he would pay money for her, and I
could spare her if I had to. You said,
mamma, we might be turned out of the house,
and then what would Blackie do for a home?
I think she would be happy in a big house,
and we would give the man the basket she
sleeps in, so she would be contented and
remember us, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, who would take her to the gentleman?”
said Mrs. Henson. “I fear he would
think it foolish.”</p>

<p>“I will take her,” said the child.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mary wended her way to
the mansion, with Blackie and the basket, and
asked for the Hon. Mr. Colebrook. That gentleman
rarely had time to see adults, but he would
not refuse a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>When he entered the room he found little
Mary Henson with her basket and her dog,
her eyes very red with weeping, and the dog
whining as though she had heard the whole plan
of separation from those she loved in the poor
home.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you my Blackie, sir, to sell
her to you. Mamma needs money for rent,
and as you are rich I thought you would like
to buy her. She will love you very much, and
kiss your face. She always sleeps with me,
and perhaps she would sleep with you.”</p>

<p>“And can you spare her?” said the millionaire.
“I fear she would cry for her former
home. It seems to me that you have been
crying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I did cry some when I kissed her
the last time, and mamma and Helen and James
all cried, because, you see, Mr. Colebrook, she
is all we have to love!”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you ask for her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Mamma owes ten dollars
for rent for the two months. I think, maybe,
if you would pay that for her you could pay
half now, and the landlady might wait for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
other half, because she would know you would
surely pay. I thought of selling Blackie to
her, but Blackie needs a very nice home. Mme.
Wainwright gave her to me, so you see Blackie
comes from a good family, sir, and puts up
with our poor home because we all love her
so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will take her,” said Mr. Colebrook,
“and if she cries I will send for you to comfort
her.”</p>

<p>All this time Blackie was laying her head
close to the child, as much as to say: “We
will not be separated.” When the millionaire
attempted to take her she growled, and then
looked plaintively toward her little mistress.</p>

<p>“He’ll be very good to you, Blackie,” said
the child, who could not stop her tears. She
wanted to sell the dog, and yet if she could only
have the money and Blackie too! But that was
impossible.</p>

<p>“I have no little girl to pet the dog,” said
the great man, “and I fear she will be lonely.
You must come and see her,” and he put the
ten dollars into the child’s hand, bade her good
afternoon, and closed the door on a very sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
little heart. Blackie crouched down in her
basket as though the fine house were of no
importance, and whined piteously for the little
girl who had left her.</p>

<p>Mary sobbed all the way home, but she
clasped the ten dollars tightly, and was thankful
that they could all have a house over their
heads for a little longer.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought the ten dollars, mamma,” said
the child, and she laid it in her mother’s lap
and stole away to weep alone over her sorrow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henson was very sad over the matter.
If she could earn but ten extra dollars! But
she could not. The dog was probably not
worth over a quarter of that sum, and the rich
man had bought her just to help the family.
Well, Blackie would have a home of luxury,
and that was a comfort.</p>

<p>Hon. Mr. Colebrook had become interested
in the child, and called at the little home a
few days later to see how the widow and her
family were prepared to meet the coming cold
weather.</p>

<p>He asked for Mary. She was not well, the
mother said, and had no appetite. “I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
she misses Blackie,” said Mrs. Henson, “though
she never speaks of her.”</p>

<p>“And the dog misses her, too, for she will
neither eat nor play,” said Mr. Colebrook. “I
hope she will be better soon, for she is a winsome
little creature. We are already fond of
her.”</p>

<p>“We are glad to have her in so good a
home,” said Mrs. Henson.</p>

<p>“How do matters look for the winter?” said
the man of means. “Is the rent provided for,
and the coal in the cellar?”</p>

<p>“I think we can get along now, since you
kindly paid the rent for two months. I am in
better health, and James seems to be selling
more papers.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Colebrook had gone Mary stole
out to ask about Blackie. She could not go
to see the dog,&mdash;that would give pain to two,&mdash;but
she was eager to hear about her mute
little playmate.</p>

<p>“Mr. Colebrook says Blackie will not eat
much and misses you greatly,” said Mrs. Henson.
A smile crept over the child’s face as she
said: “I thought Blackie really loved me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
would go to see her if she wouldn’t feel bad
when I came away, and I mustn’t make her
heart ache.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think she’ll forget about us all soon,
and enjoy her new home very much!” said
Helen.</p>

<p>“I think not,” said Mary. “Blackie never
forgets. She never did.”</p>

<p>It was late in the autumn, and Mrs. Henson
was too busy with work to think much more
about a dog. James was up early and home
late, and Helen’s little hands were more than
filled with work too hard for a child.</p>

<p>Christmas was near at hand, and the rich
and the poor were planning according to their
means for a merry time. Mrs. Henson’s presents
must necessarily be small, and along the
line of the absolutely necessary. James must
have boots, Helen a simple dress, and Mary
some mittens, with a bag of parched corn, a
little candy, and a few nuts.</p>

<p>Mr. Colebrook did not forget the widow’s
family. He sent coal, a barrel of flour, some
money for rent, and some articles of clothing
for the children. There was one quite large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
package for Mary. What was in it nobody
could imagine, though Mrs. Henson was in the
secret. Finally a low whining was heard; the
box was hastily opened, and out sprang Blackie
into Mary’s lap, and kissed her over and over
again. The child cried, and Blackie nestled
her face against Mary’s neck and cried also.
She was home again as a Christmas present,
and she liked the plain home better than the
grand one.</p>

<p>“Did you really want to come back, Blackie,”
said Mary, “and sleep with me again, and not
be rich and great any more?” and Blackie
wagged her tail and whined approvingly, as
though it were the happiest Christmas of her
life.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE CHRISTIAN HUNTER.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">“THIS IS Mr. Graham, a leader in our
church work,” said Miss Ward, as she
introduced the fine-looking young man to her
friend Miss Warburton.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said the person addressed. “I
remember seeing you at the lakes last summer.
What a pleasant company we had at the
hotel!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I went especially for the shooting.
Such fine game up there! Birds of many
kinds, ducks, and now and then a deer. I went
just for sport, though I didn’t care much about
the things after they were shot. We went fishing
one day, and the fish were so small we let a
quantity die in the bottom of the boat rather
than carry them home. We had quite an
excitement one day when we found we had
killed a robin and her youngsters were in a
nest close by with open mouths.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with the little birds?”
said Miss Warburton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, they had to starve, of course!”</p>

<p>“And did you bring home the mother bird?”</p>

<p>“No, she was pretty badly hurt, and couldn’t
live long. We had so many ducks and other
things that we couldn’t carry all of them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel badly to leave a wounded
robin or duck to die slowly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we men haven’t women’s hearts, Miss
Warburton, or we shouldn’t shoot at all, I
fear!”</p>

<p>“I never could see how a Christian man
could find pleasure in giving pain. I know
some of our professing Christians have hunted
buffaloes on the American plains, and left them
to die, just for the sport of killing, as some of
the English hunters do in South Africa. And
I suppose some who hunt foxes, and find
pleasure in seeing dogs catch and tear them
to pieces, profess Christianity.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ladies are eager to ride fast and
get the brush.”</p>

<p>“I should not be. I would not take the tail
of the fox after the poor thing had been frightened
nearly to death before capture. We think
bull-fights in Spain, where animals are killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
for sport, brutal and wicked; but we seem to
think that where foxes are killed for sport it
is only a pleasant and exhilarating pastime.
Does the size of the animal make the difference?”</p>

<p>“I think, Miss Warburton, you would deprive
us of all pleasure. Nothing is more bracing
than the eager run with the dogs over fields
and fences, and the rivalry in reaching the game
first is very exciting.”</p>

<p>“And the next day or the next week you
come back and lead a prayer meeting, and urge
us to be gentle and tender, and trust in Him
who lets not even a sparrow fall to the ground
without his notice! I think Cowper was right
when he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6d p1">“‘I would not enter on my list of friends<br />
(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,<br />
Yet wanting sensibility), the man<br />
Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.’”</p>

<p class="p1">“But, Miss Warburton, you must remember
that animals are killed for food for you and me,
and for others.”</p>

<p>“That should be done as humanely as possible,
Mr. Graham. Our stock-yards and places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for killing animals should all be under the most
careful city or State supervision. We can
easily brutalize people. At first, most men and
women shrink from inflicting pain or shedding
blood, but even those high in church or State
can become callous to cruelty.”</p>

<p>“I fear you wouldn’t approve of letting ministers
and presidents have a little fun from
shooting.”</p>

<p>“No, not if that ‘fun’ took even birds away
from their young, and helpless creatures were
shot for the mere pleasure of shooting. The
Princess of Wales, thanks to her womanly
heart, has helped to put an end to pigeon-shooting
for sport, and balls are found to
answer the purpose.”</p>

<p>“This is getting personal. I fear you will
not enjoy having me lead our meetings and
asking sinners to become converted.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Mr. Graham. Some
persons may not feel as I do, but for myself it
greatly lessens the force of your words or
prayers. I have spoken plainly because I believe
your killing for sport has a bad influence
over others. To me it does not seem consistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with your profession of kindness and
love to all of God’s creatures. I hope you are
not offended.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, far from it! You have set me
thinking. It has been thoughtlessness on my
part, for as a leader in Christian things I want
to do what is right.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">LOVE’S CHRISTMAS GIFT.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap00 p2">“I THINK George Thomas is fond of Edith,
for he comes to the house often, and
always gives her a delicate deference which
shows his appreciation of woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Sinclair in reply to his wife,
“Thomas is a good fellow, a hard worker,
economical, and worthy of any girl, though of
course he isn’t rich. That doesn’t matter, however,
for I have enough for Edith. I’ve often
wondered why he didn’t offer himself.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine,” replied his wife, “except
that he does not earn enough to support Edith
in the way she has been accustomed to live.
Young men are unduly sensitive about that,
when often the young woman would value a
true affection more than a fine house and surroundings.
I am sure Edith is fond of him, for
although she says nothing her face and manner
show it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we can help matters, wife.
Probably time will settle it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>But time did not settle it, for Edith Sinclair,
for some unexplained reason, was growing pale
and listless. Something was wearing her nerves,
and at last she was really ill. Naturally frail, and
loving one to whom she could not make known
her feelings, the repression, uncertainty, and
perhaps surprise that no word was spoken
finally culminated in her illness.</p>

<p>A physician was called, a woman who had
long been the friend of the family; she divined
some trouble that was not apparent to the
world. One morning when she came, taking
Edith’s hand she said, “Dear, I think something
is worrying you. Would you mind telling
me so that I can help you, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to be done, doctor,” said
the girl sadly, as tears came into her large,
dark eyes. “I have everything in this beautiful
home, but I don’t care for it.”</p>

<p>“But what would make you happy&mdash;to go
away for a time and have change of air and
scenery?”</p>

<p>“No, I would rather stay here. I am too
tired to go away.”</p>

<p>“Edith, I must tell you what I think is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
truth. You love Mr. Thomas, and are unwilling
that he or anybody should know it.”</p>

<p>“I admire him very much,” said the girl
slowly.</p>

<p>“But why have you never let him see that
you liked him?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do that, doctor. He knows that
we are good friends.”</p>

<p>“Has he ever spoken of marriage?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Would you marry him if he asked you?”</p>

<p>“If he loved me&mdash;never without.”</p>

<p>“What if I should find out his feelings for
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not for the world, doctor! Let that
come of his own free will if at all.”</p>

<p>“But you are ill, child, and you are letting
the matter prey upon your strength and health.
Mr. Thomas is a noble young man, and I believe
is fond of you.”</p>

<p>“We must wait, doctor. I shall be better
soon.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas called a few days later, but
Edith was too ill to see him, and he left his
regrets with her parents. He went home sadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to think of his future. He loved Edith, he was
happy in her refined society, but his salary was
not large, and he could not support her as he
desired. She would tire of the home he could
give her, and be unhappy, he thought. He
called again, but as before was unable to see
Edith.</p>

<p>He finally resolved to talk with her parents
and tell them of his love for her, and why he
had waited until he was better able to provide
for her; but she was an only child, and he hesitated
to commit himself. Others liked her, and
he loved her too well to take her into privation.
Besides, the parents, while they liked him,
might not be at all willing to give him their
daughter. He would talk with her physician,
and she, a woman, would know whether Edith
were really interested in him.</p>

<p>He called upon Dr. Mary Armstrong as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>“I have come to ask about my friend, Miss
Sinclair,” he said, as he sat in the physician’s
parlor. “Is she better?”</p>

<p>“No, she does not mend at all. There
seems to be some weight upon her heart or
life that is breaking her down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood came to the young man’s face,
but how could he know that “the weight”
upon her heart meant love for him! Perhaps
he was too presuming. After an awkward
silence he said, “Doctor, I must confide in you.
I love Miss Sinclair, but I have never had
the means to marry her. I have had a
mother and sister to make a home for, and I
could not ask another to share my poverty. I
do not know that Edith returns my affection,
though we have had a delightful friendship
together.”</p>

<p>“She loves you, I feel sure,” said her doctor,
“and I think your mistake has been that you
and she have not had an understanding sooner.
Edith is a sensitive, lovely girl, delicately reared,
and almost too careful of the conventionalities
of life, or she would have shown her love for
you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the time has come to tell her
that I love her?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not just yet. I will tell her of our
conversation and make her ready for the meeting.”</p>

<p>Young Thomas went away with a lighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
heart than he had had for months. At last
Edith would know all and wait for him, if she
loved him.</p>

<p>Dr. Armstrong came every day to the Sinclair
home, but the sick girl grew no better.
Soon after this talk with Mr. Thomas the
doctor said to Edith, “I have had a visit from
your friend, and, just as I expected, he loves
you, but has never asked your hand in marriage
because he has so many cares at home and a
small salary.”</p>

<p>The white face grew eager and flushed with
color. “I told him,” Dr. Armstrong continued,
“that he had made a mistake in not having
an understanding with you, and then both
could wait for marriage if circumstances made
such waiting wise. Do you want to see him,
Edith?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as soon as I am a little stronger. I
feel too weak to-day.”</p>

<p>Several days passed, and strength did not
return rapidly, but a new peace had come into
Edith’s life, for she loved and was beloved, and
then there was a happy meeting of the two
lovers, but a quiet one of few words and promises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Weeks and months went by, during which
time hope and love worked the same miracle
that has been wrought thousands of times since
the world began.</p>

<p>Edith walked in the sunshine of a new day
and a new life of restored health and vigor.
The autumn leaves took on their color, and red
showed itself again in the young girl’s cheeks.</p>

<p>When Christmas day came, that precious day
of giving and receiving, George Thomas and
Edith Sinclair gave themselves to each other
for life.</p>

<h2 class="p4">AN UNFORTUNATE SAIL.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">“THE SUNSET is so lovely we might take a
row on the ocean,” said Mr. Farneaux
to the young lady who was walking beside him.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite like to go on Sunday evening,”
said the girl. “But we wouldn’t stay long,
would we?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, only till the sun went down! And
we have just come from church, so where’s the
harm?”</p>

<p>So a little rowboat was engaged for an hour,
and two happy persons pushed off the Jersey
Island coast. They chatted merrily as the red
and yellow of the clouds played on the waters,
and let the boat half drift toward the sunset.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young man dropped one of the
oars. A shade of fear passed over Louise
Arnot’s face.</p>

<p>“Can you reach it?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, don’t fear!” and he took the other
oar and guided the boat toward the missing
paddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The breeze was blowing off the land, and
increasing. The boat was not easily managed
with one oar, and the cheery face of young
Farneaux grew a little troubled as the oar
drifted faster than the boat.</p>

<p>Anxiety does not give a steady hand, and
before he knew it the other oar had slipped
from his grasp.</p>

<p>Miss Arnot’s face grew white. “What shall
we do? We are drifting out to sea. Would
they see us if we were to signal to the shore?
Ours is the only boat out. Oh! why did we
start at all?”</p>

<p>“Accidents will happen. I must jump for
the oars. I am a good swimmer. Don’t get
frightened and let the boat tip and fill with
water. I’ll soon be back.”</p>

<p>“But you may be drowned,” said the
frightened girl. “I wish I could swim, and
so help you.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Keep the boat steady as I jump,
and I’ll have them in hand soon. I must
throw off this coat, so I can swim.” He rose,
put his hand on the side, and gave a leap into
the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Her heart sank within her as he went, but
there was nothing else possible to be done.</p>

<p>The boat, lightened of its freight, glided on
further and further from shore. She wished
she were heavier to hold it down. She wished
she could reach one oar while he obtained the
other, as both had now floated far apart. She
watched him breathlessly as he swam away.
Impeded somewhat by his clothes, he yet swam
hastily and caught one oar, holding it up to
Louise’s delighted eyes.</p>

<p>He did not see that the boat was drifting fast
away from him. But he must have the other
oar. Both persons were helpless without it,
so he redoubled his efforts. He felt the breeze
stiffening. What if he could not reach the
oar? What if he could not reach the boat
with its fair owner? What if Louise were to
drift out to sea and be drowned, and her death
be laid at his door? No, that should not be;
and he put his whole strength against the
waves. He gained in speed, and soon held the
coveted oar in his grasp.</p>

<p>He looked toward the skiff. Alas! it was
smaller to his sight and almost flying before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the wind. He started with the oars, but he felt
himself weakening. He must throw them away
if he would overtake the boat, and then it would
be certain death to both. The moments were
agonizing. Even if he did reach Louise, he
could not swim with her to the shore. If he
reached the bank himself, he could get friends
to put out and save her.</p>

<p>Thus reasoning, he sorrowfully dropped the
oars and swam for life. The wind had now
become violent and he was losing strength, but
fear and despair nerve us to our uttermost;
and finally, well nigh exhausted, he touched
the shore. He was grateful, but almost overcome
with sorrow as well as fatigue.</p>

<p>An excited crowd gathered around him.</p>

<p>“Where is the young lady?” they asked.</p>

<p>“We lost the oars, and she has drifted out to
sea. God help her!”</p>

<p>“Coward!” shouted the crowd, who are
usually blind and unreasoning.</p>

<p>“Nobody’ll believe such a yarn,” said one.</p>

<p>“We heard cries of ‘Murder!’ ’way back here
on the shore,” shouted others, for there is always
a class of persons who fill life with imaginary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
evils, as though it were not full enough of real
ones.</p>

<p>“Arrest him&mdash;he deserves lynching,” said
others, who knew and honored the young girl
who was now missing.</p>

<p>“Man a boat and let us go and bring her
back,” persisted young Farneaux, but the
people laughed him to scorn. The case was
plainly against him. He had taken her out
and came back without her. He could swim
and she could not, and he had basely deserted
or murdered her. Besides, no rowboat could
live in the fast-increasing waves. The officers
hurried Farneaux off to jail, and he was indicted
for homicide. In vain he protested; in vain he
begged for clemency till the matter could be
investigated. No, they would keep him close
in hand, and if anything favorable developed
they would give him the benefit.</p>

<p>Meantime what had become of the rowboat?
It had drifted out into the deep ocean with its
helpless occupant. The sun went down in a
blaze of light, but the beautiful red and orange
colors brought no joy to the eyes that peered in
vain toward the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Farneaux would not desert me,” she
murmured. “Where can he be?” and she
shaded her eyes with her hand, hoping to see
the dim outline of a human being.</p>

<p>The stars came out slowly one by one, and
gradually she knew that she was at the mercy
of the great ocean and the God who rules over
all. What might come she hardly dared to
think. If a storm did not arise, she might float
on and on. If the wind rose higher, more
water would come into the boat, for it dipped
already, and then death was certain.</p>

<p>She began to grow hungry and faint, but she
must not give up. The hours grew toward
midnight. There was no use to call aloud, for
there was no soul to respond. The boat
lurched, and was now half full of water. She
could only pray and wait in agony.</p>

<p>One hour, two hours, three hours, four hours,
five hours, which were as long as weeks, and
then the sun streaked the eastern sky, and came
up as grandly and joyously as though no hearts
were breaking on land or sea.</p>

<p>“O Father in heaven, if some ship might
only pass this way!” she moaned. So thirsty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
but no water&mdash;so hungry, but no food&mdash;weak
from loss of sleep, but with nerves strung to
their utmost tension in the eager watching for
a sail.</p>

<p>The whole forenoon passed. The mid-day
sun grew hot and parching, and hope was finally
giving way to despair. The whole of life had
been reviewed, with thoughts of the dear ones
waiting for her. The whole afternoon dragged
on, the sun set, and the second weary night was
to be lived through, or death might come before
morning. Hunger and fear had blanched the
face, and death even was beginning to lose its
terrors from the numbness of the physical.</p>

<p>The night wore away, long and weary and
desolate, and again morning dawned. Louise
was sitting in the water of the boat, her limbs
chilling, scarce knowing now if she were dead
or alive. It was growing toward noon again;
forty hours alone on the ocean, and death seemingly
near at hand.</p>

<p>Something appeared in the distance. What!
Did she see with her half-blind eyes the smoke
of a coming vessel? Could it be, or was it only
a mirage which had deceived again and again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, it actually came nearer; but would it see
her, a mere speck on the ocean? She would
gather strength enough to wave her handkerchief.
Ah! it really was a vessel. God help
her now in her one last gleam of hope! She
had no strength to call, and even if she had
probably such call would be useless. How
earnestly she prayed, gaining new lease of life
from this new hope!</p>

<p>“There’s something ahead,” said the man at
the lookout. “Perhaps a body floating out at
sea; no, it looks like a rowboat&mdash;perhaps a
drifting lifeboat of some steamer.” And word
was given to bring the ship alongside.</p>

<p>“Heaven help us&mdash;why, there’s a girl in
the boat alone!”</p>

<p>“Lower a lifeboat, boys, and pull out for
her.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” said the men, with eager
hearts, for none have warmer than those who
sail the ocean.</p>

<p>Louise’s heart bounded for joy when she
saw the sturdy oarsmen come near. She would
have fainted hours before, but now she wept
with gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a long way ye are from home,” said
one broad-shouldered sailor, as he lifted her in
his arms like a child, and carried her into the
lifeboat.</p>

<p>She was too weak to tell the story now, and
wondering how it all happened the men carried
back their precious freight to the ship.</p>

<p>The captain and officers showed her every
kindness, offering her food when she could partake
of it, and giving her every chance for rest
and sleep.</p>

<p>“But we cannot take you home,” said the
kind-hearted man. “We are on our way to
America. It must be weeks before our return.”</p>

<p>“I am so thankful for all your kindness. I
can wait anywhere, only so I send them word of
my safety.”</p>

<p>The steamer arrived on the Atlantic coast
May 19, just one month after the almost fatal
boat-ride.</p>

<p>On the other side of the ocean there was
sorrow and suspense. Louise’s home was desolate
for its lost one. Public opinion was still
bitter against the author of her misfortune.
With innocent heart, but blanched face, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Farneaux was brought from jail to the crowded
court-room for his trial on the charge of homicide.
Every day and hour he had hoped for
some word that would show him to be guiltless,
but days grew into weeks, and neither the boat
nor Louise Arnot was found. He supposed
her dead, but hoped some vessel would report
the empty boat, or have picked up at sea the
missing one.</p>

<p>The prosecution made out a strong case.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Farneaux’s story were true,” said the
attorney, “that he was unable to reach her, and
therefore saved his life by swimming ashore,
her body would have been found on the beach
long before this. She was last seen in his company.
It was an easy matter to sink the oars
and then swim to shore after the deed was
done. Thirty days have gone by, long enough
for any vessel to have picked her up and
restored her to her heart-broken family, if she
were alive.”</p>

<p>And then for hours the enormity of the deed,
the coaxing her to go upon the ocean that Sabbath
evening, the cold-bloodedness of the whole
affair, were gone over by able lawyers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Farneaux’s face grew white, and his body
trembled at the accusations. And then he told
in straightforward language the story of his
losing the oars, of the increasing wind so that
he could scarcely gain the shore, of the impossibility
of reaching her with his heavy oars in
hands, and of the certainty of death for both if
he attempted it.</p>

<p>“He talks like an innocent fellow,” said one.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have known him for years, and he’s
a well-brought-up young man, but I’ve known
well-brought-up people turn out to be fiends,”
said another.</p>

<p>“Not often if they have Christian parents,”
said a third. “That young man has a good
mother, and it’s rare that the son of such a
mother goes wrong. I believe in the man. I’d
be willing to wager a good deal that his story
is true.”</p>

<p>Several witnesses testified as to good character,
but one fact was patent to all, that Louise
Arnot went out with him and he came back
alone, excited, anxious, and seemingly greatly
disturbed. He could prove nothing, and circumstances
were against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Away in America the sick girl, now coming
to her usual health by care, was writing a
cable message the hour the ship arrived.
“How glad they will be! Poor Mr. Farneaux
will be so anxious. He swam for the boat, I
know, just as long as he could.”</p>

<p>So the words were sent: “Louise Arnot
picked up at sea in open boat. Arrived in
New York May 19. Well.”</p>

<p>A courier came to the crowded court-room
and delivered the message. A hush fell upon
the assembly, and then a cheer broke out, and
tears rolled down the cheeks of the man accused
of murder. The proceedings were
stayed, and the townspeople waited eagerly for
the coming of Miss Arnot, that she might tell
the story of why she was left alone through
those terrible forty hours.</p>

<p>The captain had taken Miss Arnot to his
home till she should fully recover and be able
to make the return voyage. One day as she
was reading the daily paper her eye fell upon
the words, “Supposed murder at sea,” and
where was detailed the arrest of Mr. Farneaux
and his unexpected deliverance by her cable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“What if I had not been rescued,” she
said, “and had died in the boat! Who could
have saved my poor, dear friend then?” And
anew she thanked God for her miraculous
deliverance, and for saving the life of her friend.</p>

<p>A few weeks later Miss Arnot was home in
her beloved island, her friends gathering about
her. All were eager for her side of the story.
“Mr. Farneaux has told the truth,” she said,
“and I am more thankful for his life even than
for my own. What would have been my agony
if he had suffered death for me!”</p>

<p>Time will tell what the sequel will be!
Whatever life has before them, neither will forget
the awful experience of being on the sea
alone, drifting helplessly, or on trial for murder
with no power to prove one’s innocence. And
each is thankful for that wonderful deliverance.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A NEW KIND OF WEDDING.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap00 p2">“I DO NOT want the usual kind of wedding,”
said the pretty daughter of Jared Strong,
the millionaire of Huntsville. “I would rather
use the money spent for flowers and supper
in a way that pleases me better.”</p>

<p>“And what would please you?” said the
gracious man, who loved his daughter with an
especial fondness now that her mother was
dead. “You are a queer girl.”</p>

<p>“I will spend the money wisely, if I may
have it.”</p>

<p>“But what will the young man you are to
marry think of a simple and private wedding,
and what will the people in society think, who
have entertained you?”</p>

<p>“They know already that I care little for
parties or clubs. Going into one of the
‘Settlements’ and seeing how the poor live
cured me of extravagance. Why, the money
spent for one grand party would make one
hundred poor people comfortable for a year!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, the suppers and making the fine
silks give employment to people,” said Mr.
Strong.</p>

<p>“But you forget, father, how much further
the money would go if spent otherwise. A
florist receives one thousand dollars for flowers.
His family and a few workmen are
benefited, but that thousand dollars would
keep scores of families from starving or cold,
if properly used. Many, unable to obtain
work,&mdash;and we know from statistics that quite
a large per cent. cannot possibly get it,
because there is not work enough for all,&mdash;would
be cheered and kept from discouragement
if rent could be paid for a time, or
clothes furnished, or coal given, or comforts
provided in sickness.”</p>

<p>“Do as you wish, my child. You shall
have the money to spend as you like. I fear,
however, that the world will call you peculiar.
You know there has always been poverty and
always will be.”</p>

<p>“But we who are rich have duties to those
who are not so fortunate. I learned at the
‘Settlement’ how the luxuries of the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
make the poor feel discouraged and unhappy.
They work, and they see idlers all about
them who are haughty when they should be
kind and courteous. The poor see many of
the rich waste their time in hunting or useless
pleasure. They see people living for
self, with no thought of the homeless or over-worked.
They see clothes thrown away or
hoarded, when they might be of use to somebody.”</p>

<p>“What does my dear Louise wish for her
wedding day? No jewels and laces and rejoicing
over the happy event?”</p>

<p>“Well, let us see how much I can save to use
as I like. I prefer to be married quietly in our
own home, with only a few friends together. I
do not want many outside presents, for people
give more than they can afford generally, and
because they feel that social customs demand
it. The flowers, if the church and house were
elaborately trimmed, would cost a thousand
dollars, the supper for a large company another
thousand, the elegant wardrobe, which I do not
wish, another thousand. Now I would rather
have this to spend for myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“You shall have it, daughter, and we will see
how you will spend it. You will be the talk of
Huntsville.”</p>

<p>Louise Strong, college educated, was about
to marry a young man who was graduated from
the same class as herself. He had wealth and
did not need her fortune; besides, he loved her
well enough to let her decide what would make
her happiest.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving college she entered one
of the college “Settlements,” partly because
some of her friends were trying the experiment,
and partly because she had an interest in those
less fortunate than herself. She found it true,
indeed, that “one-half the world does not know
how the other half lives.”</p>

<p>While one part dressed in purple and fine
linen and fared sumptuously every day, another
had scarcely enough to eat or to wear, slept on
poor beds if any, with insufficient bedding to
keep them from the cold, in tumble-down tenement
houses, with high rents and no conveniences.
With pinched faces and oftentimes bitter
hearts they looked on the showy equipages,
elegant mansions, and extravagant dresses of
many of the rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>True, there were some who, either because
of their refined tastes or Christian principles,
made little display, and gave of their surplus to
bless humanity, but the majority lived for self
and let the rest of the world struggle as it might.
They would not take on responsibility, and in
no wise regarded themselves as holding their
property in trust for the betterment of the
world. They had made their money and they
would spend it as they chose. To God or man
they did not feel responsible. Only when death
came did they begin to ask if life had been
well spent.</p>

<p>Louise Strong had gone into poor homes and
cared for sick children; she had given sympathy
and money; she had read to weary and
lonely persons; she had encouraged the
despondent, tried to find situations for those
out of work, helped to make the “Settlement”
a social home and place of elevation and rest,
and learned, best of all, that life is worse than
useless unless lived for the sake of others.</p>

<p>And now what should she do with the three
thousand dollars that were to be spent for the
wedding if she did not use them in charity?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
There were so many ways to spend it that one
could scarcely select. The libraries needed
more books; some of the children in the Sunday
School of her church needed proper clothing;
the people in jails ought to have books
and papers; the poor who hesitated to ask
charity because it was so often grudgingly
given at the public institutions, and often to the
unworthy, needed coal and food and clothes;
many boys and girls longed for a college education
and were helpless in getting it; the
colored people in the South needed education
and to be taught industries; the temperance
cause needed money and workers. How should
she use her three thousand dollars?</p>

<p>One of the friends she had made at the
“Settlement,” Alice Jameson, had often said
she wished she could visit among the poor and
be their friend, but she had no means. Louise
knew that personal contact with human beings
is the best way to improve them. She went to
see her friend Alice.</p>

<p>“I have a proposition to make,” she said to
Alice. “I can have the money for my wedding
to use as I please. How would you like to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
my missionary? I to pay you a salary, and
you to visit in your own field and tell me all
the needy and helpless, so that you and I can
find a way to brighten their lives.”</p>

<p>“I should be more delighted than you can
imagine,” said Alice. “Call me the ‘Louise
Missionary.’ And now, as the cold weather is
coming, I think you will want to provide me
with one or two hundred pairs of mittens and
warm stockings, and perhaps you will like to
use some of the money in Christmas gifts for
those who rarely have presents.”</p>

<p>“Capital,” said Louise. “And I have
another suggestion. I love animals so much,
dogs and horses especially, that I want children
taught to be kind to them. Let us put two
hundred copies of ‘Our Dumb Animals,’ each
fifty cents a year, into as many homes, for
nobody can read that paper without being
kinder all his life.”</p>

<p>Louise Strong was married quietly to one
of the noblest men of the city, and Alice Jameson
began her labor of love. After one year of
work, and gifts supplied by Louise, of course a
generous father and husband would not see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
enterprise abandoned. The incidents of the
next few years, told by Alice to Louise, the
dying cared for, children saved and placed in
good homes, men helped and women cheered,
would fill a volume. Louise, thus kept in touch
with the world’s sorrow, did not forget and
become selfish. How many lives were blessed
with that wedding money!</p>

<h2 class="p4">LOST HIS PLACE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap03 p2">“WE ARE sorry to let you go, James, but
business is dull and we must cut
down expenses.”</p>

<p>The speaker was the head of a hardware
store, a man not unkind in nature, but who
looked at business purely as a money-making
matter. Men were not to be carried over a
long winter if there was no need for their
help.</p>

<p>James Leonard’s eyes fell on the paper where
he was writing with a sadder expression than
before, but he said nothing. Both of his
parents were dead. He was not strong in
body, and none too well fitted to cope with the
obstacles one meets in the daily struggle for
existence. He would, of course, look for work,
but that it was not easy to find he had proved
when attempting to get a situation several
months before. He had very little money
saved for his board, for wages had been small.
He would keep his inexpensive room, eat but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
two meals a day, if need be, and hoped his
money would last till a place could be found.</p>

<p>The next morning he started out, not over-courageous,
but determined to be persevering.
From store to store, from office to office, he
asked for work, and received the same old
reply&mdash;“We are discharging men, rather
than hiring new ones.” Days went by and
grew into weeks. He came home hungry,
cold, and tired. There was nobody to confer
with or to cheer him. He could not get bookkeeping&mdash;that
was hopeless. He would take
any kind of work that could be obtained, for
his money was growing perilously scant.</p>

<p>Finally, despite his delicate appearance, a
man hired him at small wages at heavy outdoor
work. As might have been expected, his
hands were soon blistered, insufficient food left
him with little strength, and he broke down
from the labor.</p>

<p>The woman at whose house James had his
room cared for him as best she could, but
she also was poor and could not long provide
for him without remuneration. He must have
money for food and fuel. He could not go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the poorhouse, he could not go to a hospital
while half-way able to work, and he had no
relatives upon whom he could depend.</p>

<p>Resolutions to do right are sometimes broken
when everything seems against a person.
James was cold and needed an overcoat. Possibly
he could have begged one; possibly not,
for the world is not over-generous with overcoats.
He saw one in the hall of a house
which he was passing; the night was bitter
cold&mdash;he opened the unfastened door, stole
the coat, and hurried away.</p>

<p>He was restless that night as he attempted to
sleep. He was cold, and in his dreams put on
an overcoat that did not fit him, and he felt ill
at ease. As he wore it next day, though it was
black, he thought everybody looked at it. The
owner might recognize it by the cut of the
collar or the sleeves. He was not happy, but
he was warm, and by and by, as he walked, he
forgot that the coat was not really his own and
paid for with his own money.</p>

<p>He could find nothing to do in the city. He
could go out into the suburbs; perhaps in the
homes of wealth they would feel neither the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
hard times nor the need for retrenchment in
winter. He walked all day, and slept in a barn
at night. The next day he went from house to
house, and there was no more success than
before.</p>

<p>As night came on he passed a beautiful
home back from the street, where the windows
were lighted and all seemed inviting and
happy. He looked in at the window. The
daughter of the house sat reading in the cosey
library, and a servant was preparing supper in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>He walked away, and then went back. There
must be a good deal of food in so cheerful a
home, and he needed some. He had asked for
food before this, and sometimes a kind lady
gave him hot coffee with his bread and butter,
but oftener the servants refused.</p>

<p>He would wait till later, and then, unperceived,
he would enter the pantry and take
what he needed for the night and the day following.
It was cold remaining outside, and the
hours to wait seemed very long, but then he
was used to waiting for everything. There was
little else for him to do nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The lights were turned out early, for there
had been a party at the house the previous
night. He lifted the slightly fastened kitchen
window, entered the pantry, and ate what food
he needed, filling his pockets for the next day’s
use.</p>

<p>He was going away when something bright
gleamed before him. It was a basket of silver
ready to be put into the safe, but carelessly left
for the morrow. That, if sold, would give him
money enough to last the winter through.</p>

<p>He had to think and act quickly. Before he
had time to argue with himself the right or
the wrong of it he had gathered all and put it
into a satchel close at hand. The satchel was
heavy, but he hurried away, secreting some of
it, after he left the house, near or partly under a
stone wall.</p>

<p>He feared somebody on the street would
hear the silver rattle, or somebody in the street-car
would hit his foot against it. Every eye
seemed upon the satchel, and he was glad to
get out of the car and take it to a pawn-shop.
As usual, the pawn-broker beat him down in the
price of the silver. He knew the young man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
necessities and offered him not over a fifth
of its value. Young Leonard demurred, but
finally took the money and hurried away.</p>

<p>Again he looked for work and found some
for a day or two. He used his money carefully,
and when it was gone went stealthily
to the hidden place by the wall, dug up the
silver, and took it to the pawn-broker. The
police had an agreement with the dealer in
stolen goods, and when Leonard came again
to sell he was arrested, tried, and sentenced
to prison.</p>

<p>The prison years, as those know who have
tried them, went by painfully, with much of
depression, much of good resolutions, much
of hopelessness, much of weariness and mortification.
When James Leonard was released
he determined to begin life anew. He had
the same old struggle to obtain a place, but
finally succeeded as the coachman for two
ladies. He was faithful, honest, and greatly
liked by them.</p>

<p>One day a policeman recognized him.
“Hello, James,” he said, “glad to see you in
a good home. How did they happen to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
you? Did they know you had been in
prison?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, and I wouldn’t have them for
the world! They wouldn’t trust me, and
would turn me off.”</p>

<p>“But they’ll find it out, I fear. Better be
straight, I think. I would tell all and take
my chances. If they hear it from outside
you’ll be sure to lose your place.”</p>

<p>The next persons to recognize James were
two servants, who, eager to be the bearer of
news, told the cook who worked in the same
house with James. To her a prison seemed
an awful thing, and she told the ladies. They
in turn told James they feared to trust a man
who had stolen, and discharged him. They
did not stop to ask themselves where the man
would go for a home if they turned him away.</p>

<p>The old result happened. James searched
for a situation, did not succeed, became discouraged,
was without funds, stole, and again
was sent to prison.</p>

<p>It is easy to say that James Leonard should
have been strong enough to resist temptation.
It is easy to say that all men and women can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
find places if they try long enough. At
the same time, there is a responsibility resting
upon the employer of labor when of necessity
a man loses his position. To be our brother’s
keeper is a vital point in a Christian community.</p>

<h2 class="p4">STRUCK IT RICH.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">“IT’S NO USE, Martha,” said Asa Scranton to
his wife, as he came in from the street,
tired and discouraged. “I’ve tried day after
day for a job, and I’ve come to the conclusion
that you and the children are better off without
me than with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Asa!” responded the pale, thin
woman, who was cooking dinner for some
workingmen who boarded with her. “We
shall see better days.”</p>

<p>But her words only were hopeful; the voice
showed the weariness of one who was almost
tired of the daily struggle.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it is. I’ve worked hard
from a boy. The grocery business didn’t pay,
though I never left the store till the last man
had gone home. Then the builder I worked
for failed, and I lost several months’ wages. I
guess I’m unlucky. We had quite a bit of
money when we married, didn’t we, Martha?
And I never supposed you would come to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
hard work as this. My debts have hung like
a millstone about my neck. They all say:
‘Asa Scranton, you’re a good fellow. You’ll
pay principal and interest,’ and never think
that a wife and children have need for food and
clothing. Sometimes I’ve a mind to run away,
and I would if I didn’t hate a coward. I can’t
stand seeing you so pale and hopeless-like.
I’d like to try the mines&mdash;maybe I’d strike it
rich.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Asa, don’t think of such a thing! Only
the few make any money in mines, and most
are poor to the end of their days. Keep up
courage. The children are getting larger, and
better days are coming.”</p>

<p>“That’s the old story, Martha. Things are
not very even in this world, but I don’t complain.
If I had work I wouldn’t care how rich
other folks are. But just think, Martha! If I
strike a mine, as some people have, how good
it would seem for you to have a silk dress, and
Alice a hat with a feather, like the little girl on
the hill. I always wanted John to go to college,
seeing that his father couldn’t go. He
maybe would be more lucky than I have
been.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>While Martha Scranton mended by the open
fireplace that evening, Asa sat still and thought&mdash;dreamed
dreams, half wildly perhaps, of
better days to come. They would never come
in his present poverty. He would make one
last venture. His family could live without
him, for his wife for some time had earned all
the money which they used.</p>

<p>He was not an indolent man, not a man who
lacked ability, but, like thousands of others,
he seemed to be in the current of failure, and
was drifting down the stream to despair. He
dreamed about the mines of Colorado that
night as he slept, and during the many waking
hours planned how he could reach the favored
land. He could sell his silver watch, and pawn
his overcoat, even if the coming winter pinched
him with cold.</p>

<p>By morning he had decided. He ate breakfast
quietly; patted little John upon the head,
with a look of unusual pathos in his blue eyes;
told Martha that he was going out to look for
work; obtained what little money he could;
hurried down the street to the station, wiping,
with the back of his hand, the tears from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
cheeks as he looked only once toward his home;
and took the train for the mines.</p>

<p>For days he ate little, hoarding every cent
to keep him from starvation till he should
find work. At Granite Camp, on the side of
the mountain, all was bustle and confusion.
The varied machinery, the eager miners, the
enthusiasm, the warm-hearted familiarity,&mdash;all
excited Asa. He was ready for any kind of
work, and soon found it. Mining was hard,&mdash;no
work is easy,&mdash;but he would earn and save,
and later prospect for himself, get hold of
claims, and “strike it rich.”</p>

<p>Weeks and months passed. No letter came
from Martha, for she did not know where Asa
had gone. She wept when she found that she
was left alone&mdash;wept with that half-deadened
sense of loss which persons feel who have had
the cheer of life taken out of them by the blows
of circumstance.</p>

<p>Asa had been kind to her and the children,
but in these days she had little time to think of
love or loss, for work was never-ending, and
rent and fuel were certainties. So she toiled
on, and guessed that he had gone to seek his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
fortune in the mines, and clothed the children
as well as she could, and sewed and washed
and prayed and waited.</p>

<p>Years came and went. Asa Scranton in the
mines and Martha Scranton at home were
growing older. The miners liked Asa, though
he joined little in their merry-making, and got
the name of being miserly. They could not
know that he was saving his money to make
Martha rich. Sometimes, when he had earned
money enough to work a claim, and had gotten
other parties interested, he dug for treasure,
but always failed. Then the hole was left in
the mountain, and Asa went back to his daily
digging in the mines.</p>

<p>His hair grew grayer and his form bent.
He would write Martha and Alice and John
when he had made his fortune, but not now.
He lived alone in his little shanty, often weary,
always lonely, “forever unlucky,” as he said,
but still hoping that better days would come.
Every spare moment he searched the mountains,
till it was common talk that Asa Scranton
knew every vein of silver and lead in the
surrounding country. He would make one last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
effort. He had been to one spot stealthily,
from time to time, where, from the surface ore,
he felt sure of success.</p>

<p>But how could he interest capital? He had
failed in other projects, and the world did not
believe in him. In vain he besought men to
join him. He hoarded his money, grew thin
from lack of food, dressed in ragged clothes,
and still dreamed of future success.</p>

<p>Finally a little money was put into the venture,
but no veins worth working were found.
Asa was sure they would win if they probed
further into the mountain. He labored with
men in and out of camp to put in more money.
The miners said he was crazy. He certainly
was cold and hungry, and well nigh frenzied.</p>

<p>At last he found a German, Hans Bochert,
who, like himself, had struggled for years, had
lost and won,&mdash;with many losings to one winning,&mdash;but
who, out of pity for the old miner,
gave nearly his last dollar to push on the work.</p>

<p>Asa seemed in a half delirium. He would
not leave the place day or night. Cold or rain
did not deter him, though he seemed ill and
broken. Finally the good news came that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
big body of ore was struck. Asa Scranton’s
face gleamed as though the full sunlight poured
upon it. “I’m going to my shanty to write to
Martha,” he said, and hurried away. He did
not come back in the morning, and Hans
Bochert and the other men hastened over to
know the reason.</p>

<p>Asa sat in his chair with the same halo about
his face&mdash;dead from an excess of joy. On a
paper, on the little table, was the letter he had
begun to write to Martha Scranton at Fairport:
“<i>Darling Wife</i>: I have struck it rich, and you
and the children”&mdash;</p>

<p>The pen had fallen from his hand.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">FOOD AT THE DOOR.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap06 p2">“DON’T FEED him, because others will be
sure to come.”</p>

<p>The speaker was a handsome woman who
sat at dinner with her husband in one of the
beautiful homes of C. She was dressed in a
rich garnet satin, with a bunch of yellow chrysanthemums
at her throat, which accorded with
the dark garnet leather of the carved furniture.</p>

<p>All had gone well with Mrs. Heatherstone.
Her husband, with hair prematurely gray from
his hard financial struggles, had become rich,
and his wife and only son were spending the
money in fine clothes and stylish equipages.</p>

<p>A servant had just come in to say that an
old man was at the door who had had nothing
to eat all day, and to ask if she should give
him a supper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heatherstone reiterated her old rule,
not to feed anybody at the door, lest other poor
people be told of it, and the family be annoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with tramps. “We never give anything at the
door,” she was wont to say, and so in process
of time poor people generally passed by the
Heatherstone mansion, and she was glad of it.</p>

<p>The poor old man of to-night caught a
glimpse of the well-filled table as he passed
the window, and he felt hurt and bitter at fate.
He was not a drinking man, but he had lost
his property by reverses, his wife and children
were dead, he was unable to do hard labor,
and he could rarely find work that was light
or heavy. There was not work enough for
all, and the young and vigorous obtained what
there was.</p>

<p>The old man slept in a shed that night, and
dreamed of the elegant home and the handsome
lady in the garnet dress.</p>

<p>“I think you might have given him a supper,”
said Mark Heatherstone, a boy of sixteen,
with a kind heart, but lacking a strong
will, and who had already caused his parents
some solicitude.</p>

<p>“When once you begin, there is no end of
it,” said the mother. “Let him go to the
Associated Charities or to some soup-house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“But he will have a heavy heart to-night,
besides being hungry,” said the youth.</p>

<p>“I can’t take care of all the suffering in the
world, so I shut my eyes to it. We must
enjoy ourselves, and leave some money for
you also.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind much about that,” said the
boy, who knew nothing of the hardships of
life, “but I’d do a little good as I went along.”</p>

<p>Mother and son did not think alike about
many things, and after a time the lad left his
home and disappeared from the town.</p>

<p>His parents were of course distressed beyond
measure. They searched and searched in vain.
Mrs. Heatherstone, with all her selfishness and
lack of wisdom in rearing her son, was exceedingly
fond of him. His absence aged her, and
when after some years he did not return, the
fine house and elegant clothes lost their attraction.
The habit of giving, however, is usually
a growth from early life, and closed hands do
not unclose easily as we grow older.</p>

<p>Once away from his home, Mark Heatherstone
was too proud to go back, if indeed he
ever wished to do so. He soon spent what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
money he had brought away with him, and then
learned the hard lessons of poverty. He looked
for work, occasionally found some, but oftener
was penniless, and, like the old man who had
besought alms at his father’s house, slept in
sheds or in barns. The increasing habit of
drink fastened upon him, and exposure undermined
his health.</p>

<p>Early a broken-down man, he determined to
go back to his native town, and perhaps seek
again the home he had abandoned. He stole a
ride on a freight train and reached the city just
as the evening lamps were being lighted. A
cold sleet was falling.</p>

<p>He was faint from lack of food, and excited
with the thought of the old times of boyhood
and a possible glad reception at his home. He
found the house, passed it, and saw his father
and mother at supper. He went up the street
and then returned, going to the back door and
asking for food.</p>

<p>“We never give anything at the door,” said
the well-instructed servant, and shut it in his
face. He walked away. The impulse was
strong to go back and say that the long-lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
son had returned. He hesitated, turned his
face back towards home, walked up the familiar
pathway to the front door, raised his
hand to ring the bell, became dizzy, and fell
heavily on the porch.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Heatherstone were startled at
the sound. “What has happened, husband?”
she said, and both hastened to the door. “Oh,
Mark, Mark!” exclaimed the mother, as she
gazed upon the face of her apparently dead
son. He was carried into the best apartment
and a physician summoned.</p>

<p>“It is a heart attack and he will rally,” said
the doctor, “but his living is only a question of
time.”</p>

<p>When Mark was partially restored to his former
self he told of the struggles he had been
through, of some kindness and much indifference
and hardness, even being turned away
in the rain from his mother’s door because he
asked for food. “That nearly broke my heart,
mother,” he said. “Don’t let man or dog or
cat go away from your door hungry. Who
knows but they will die upon somebody’s
doorstep?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Heatherstone grew tenderer with the
coming months, and when Mark passed away
she was a changed woman. She had been made
unselfish through a great sorrow.</p>

<h2 class="p4">HOW THE DOG TAX WAS PAID.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">TWO LITTLE children, Annie and James, were
picking up stray pieces of coal near the
railroad, to carry to a very poor home. Suddenly
they espied a black lump that looked like
coal, only it moved. With childish curiosity
they crept towards it and found a thin, frightened,
hungry dog that had been crippled and
beaten by boys.</p>

<p>“Do you dare touch her?” said the girl of
nine years. “She might bite.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Jimmie, a rugged and alert
little fellow of seven. “See, she wags her short
tail, and I guess she wants to go home with us.”</p>

<p>“But mother couldn’t take care of her, we’re
so poor, and baby Ned and Willie have to eat
and have clothes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll give her some of my bread and
milk every night, and Mrs. Martin next door
will give her bones, I guess. She hasn’t any
boy and she is good to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl put her fingers carefully along the
black dog’s forehead, and the animal pushed
her cold nose against the child’s hand and
licked it. She was not used to kind voices,
and a girl’s fingers upon her head gave her
courage. She half rose to her feet, looked from
one to the other and seemed to say, “I will go
with you if you will only take me.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t pick her up, Jimmie; she’ll follow
us.”</p>

<p>“She can’t walk much,” said the boy, “but
I’ll help her over the bad places if you’ll carry
the basket of coal.”</p>

<p>The dog seemed to realize the conversation,
for when the coal was ready to be moved, she
was also ready, and hobbled on after the
children.</p>

<p>“You must be tired, poor thing!” said Jimmie,
taking her up as they crossed a muddy
street, and thereby getting his torn jacket
stained from her hurt back and bleeding foot.</p>

<p>The dog nestled up to him and seemed
happy. When they reached home Jimmie ran
ahead, showing his poor bruised friend to his
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Jimmie, what can you do with a
dog?”</p>

<p>“Keep her to play with, and to guard the
house when you are away washing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how we’ll feed her,” said
Mrs. Conlon, who looked about as poor as the
dog, “but we’ll try. We can keep her warm
anyway if you’ll pick up enough coal.”</p>

<p>“We shall love her so,” said the boy, “and
the baby will play with her when she gets well.
Let’s call her ‘Pet,’ because we never have anything
to play with.”</p>

<p>The dog crawled behind the stove and closed
her eyes, as though thankful for a place to rest,
where at least boys would not throw stones,
and men would not kick her with their rough
boots.</p>

<p>Days and weeks went by. The black dog,
though not having a great supply of food, was
living like a prince compared with the starvation
of the street. Her bruises healed, her coat
became blacker and her eyes brighter. She was
indeed the baby’s pet, and the idol of the other
children. She went with Annie and Jimmie as
they gathered coal. She slept on the floor beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
their humble bed at night, and guarded the
household when the mother was absent. She
shared their food, and would have returned
their kindness with her life if need be. The
whole family were happier and kinder since she
came into it, as is always the case when a pet
animal is in the home.</p>

<p>Though poverty was a constant guest at the
Conlon abode, with its bare floors, poor clothes,
and common fare, yet they were not unhappy.
The mother worked too hard to philosophize
much about circumstances, and the children
were too young to realize what was before them
of struggle. A cloud was coming, and a man’s
hand brought it. It was the arrival of the tax-gatherer.</p>

<p>A high official in the State found that the
treasury was low, and decided that money must
be raised in some way. Of course it was generally
conceded that the liquor traffic caused so
much of the poverty, crime, and sorrow that it
would be wise to make it pay for some of its
evil results. This was a difficult matter, however,
as saloon keepers and their customers
had votes. Corporations could be taxed more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
heavily, but corporations sometimes paid money
to help carry elections.</p>

<p>There was at least one class that had no
votes, and consequently little influence. Dogs
could therefore be taxed. The rich could easily
pay the tax, and if the poor could not, their
dogs could be killed. Who stopped to think
whether money raised through the sorrow of the
poor, or the death of helpless animals, might
prove a bane rather than a blessing? Who
asked whether a dog did not love life as well as
his master, and whether, for his devotion and
courage and guarding of homes, he was not
entitled to the consideration of the city and the
State, rather than to be killed because his owner
could not or did not pay a tax or a license fee?
The dog had done no wrong, and though somebody
loved him, as he could not earn the fee
himself he must needs be destroyed.</p>

<p>The tax-gatherer, endowed with power by the
officials, came to the Conlon home. There was
little that could be taken from so poor a place,
thought the collector, until he espied the black dog
beside the baby’s cradle. “Your dog, madam,
must be paid for. The fee is five dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t the money,” said the woman.
“Why, I couldn’t raise so much! I can hardly
fill these four mouths with food.”</p>

<p>“Well, madam, then you shouldn’t keep a
dog.”</p>

<p>“But she guards the children while I work,
and she is such a comfort to them!”</p>

<p>“The law doesn’t take sentiment into the account.
If you were a man I should arrest you,
and shoot the dog. As it is, I will only shoot
the dog. Bring the animal out and I will call
that policeman over.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t shoot her before these crying
children?”&mdash;for three of them had begun to
cry, and were clasping the dog to their hearts,
while the baby looked scared, and pressed his
lips together, as though he realized that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>“As I said before, madam, the law has no
regard for sentiment. The State must have
money.”</p>

<p>“I wish they would tax the saloons. If my
husband hadn’t lost his money in them before
he died we should have the money now to pay
the tax for our dog. Could you wait a little for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the money? I can give you a dollar, and perhaps
I can borrow another, but I can’t possibly
raise five dollars. Can you come to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll give you a trial, but it’s a long
walk here. I’m afraid you’ll turn the dog on
the street and then say you haven’t any.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, we are not as mean as that, even
if we are poor! Pet would suffer and perhaps
starve, and we all love her too much for that.”</p>

<p>After the man was gone Mrs. Conlon put on
her faded shawl and bonnet and went to her
neighbors, as poor as herself. One loaned her
a quarter, another a half, till the whole dollar
was secured.</p>

<p>When the assessor came on the following day,
being somewhat impressed by the devotion of
both family and dog, he took the two dollars
and promised to wait a reasonable time for the
remaining three.</p>

<p>Various plans were talked over in the Conlon
home for the raising of the extra money.
There was comparatively little work to be obtained,
rent must be met or they would be
turned upon the street, and there were five
mouths to feed besides that of Pet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmie declared that a letter to the Governor
of the State ought to do good, and Annie should
write it. Accordingly a sheet of paper and an
envelope were procured that very afternoon,
and a letter was penned to that official. It
read as follows:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Governor</span>:</p>
<p>“We have a beautiful [this was a stretch of the
imagination] black dog that we found sick and
hurt, and we love her dearly, but can’t pay the
tax of five dollars. Mother works, and I take
care of the children, but I can’t earn any money
for poor dear Pet. The police have killed lots
of dogs on our street. One belonged to Mamie
Fisher, my best friend, and we went together
and found him in a pile of dogs, all dead.
Mamie took him up in her arms and cried
dreadfully. I helped her carry him, and we
dug a grave in their little yard and buried him,
and we took five cents that a lady gave me and
bought two roses and laid on his grave. He
was a big yellow puppy, and was so kind.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Governor, would you be willing
to lend us three dollars till we can earn it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
pay you back? She has two dollars already.
We wish there wasn’t any tax on dogs, for they
make us poor children so happy. Perhaps you
can stop the law.</p>

<p class="pr8">“Yours most respectful,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Annie Conlon</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">All pronounced this a proper letter, and Jimmie
dropped it into the mail-box. All the family
waited prayerfully for the answer.</p>

<p>The Governor was touched as he read this
letter from a child. “I will give her the three
dollars,” he said to his wife. “I didn’t suppose
the enforcement of a dog tax would bring
so much sorrow to little hearts and large ones
too. I really wish there were no tax on dogs,
for they are helpless creatures and most faithful
friends to man. But the State needs money.”</p>

<p>“Try to get the tax law repealed,” said the
wife. “There are plenty of ways to raise money
to pay the expenses of a great State without killing
dogs. The tax law is directly responsible
for thousands of dogs being turned upon the
street to starve: they become ill from hunger
and thirst, are supposed to be mad, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
suffer untold misery and even death from
thoughtless and excited crowds. I would have
no part in enforcing such a law, and would help
to wipe it from the statute books.”</p>

<p>“But some of the farmers have their sheep
killed by dogs, and they must have their losses
made up to them,” said the Governor.</p>

<p>“Let the town pay for the sheep which are
killed, and not cause the death of thousands of
innocent dogs because a few have done wrong,”
replied the wife.</p>

<p>The money was sent to Annie Conlon, and
there was thanksgiving in the plain home. Pet
wagged her short tail, and looked up into
Annie’s eyes, as though she understood that
her life had been spared by those three dollars.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE STORY OF DOUGLAS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap06 p2">DOUGLAS was a shaggy black puppy, one
of a family of eleven, all of them yellow
and white but himself. His fur, when you
pushed it apart, showed its yellow color near
the skin, revealing what he really was,&mdash;a St.
Bernard.</p>

<p>He was the most gentle of all the puppies,
and would not fight his way at the dish when
the others clamored for their bread and milk,
but stood apart and looked up to his mistress
with a beseeching and sometimes aggrieved
air. From the first he seemed to hunger for
human affection, and would cry to be held in
one’s lap, or follow one about the house or the
grounds like a petted kitten.</p>

<p>When quarrels took place between some
members of the large family Douglas never
joined, but hastened to tell it by his bark, that
the disturbance might be quelled.  When
finally the puppies went to various homes
Douglas became the property of a lady who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
not having children, loved him almost as a
child.</p>

<p>He followed her up and down stairs and lay
at her feet if she read. The house was well
furnished, but not too good to be used and
enjoyed. Douglas was not put out of doors at
night to whine in the rain or sleet, or even into
a barn, and wisely, for he saved the house once
from very unwelcome intruders.</p>

<p>He gambolled beside his mistress if she
walked in the woods, and when she was ill he
was constantly at her bedside, refusing to eat,
and seeming to suffer in her suffering. When
she was unavoidably absent Douglas cried and
walked the floor, and if allowed to go out of
doors howled and waited on the hillside for
her return.</p>

<p>Once when at the seashore he followed
her without her knowledge, and plunged into
the bay after her steamer. He swam till well-nigh
exhausted, his agonized owner fearing
every minute that he would sink, while she
besought the men to stop the boat. Finally he
was rescued, and though he could scarcely
move the glad look in his eyes and the wag of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
his tail told as plainly as words the joy of the
reunion.</p>

<p>No amount of money could buy the companionable
creature. He never wearied one by
talk; he never showed anger, perhaps because
no one spoke angrily to him. Some persons
like to show authority, even over a dog, and
talk loud and harsh, but Douglas’s owner was
too wise and too good for this. Kindness
begot kindness, and the puppy who longed for
love appreciated it none the less when he was
grown, and could protect the woman who loved
him.</p>

<p>One autumn day, just before leaving her
country home for the city, Miss Benson was
obliged to return to town for a half day.
“Good-by, dear Douglas,” she said in her
usual way. “I shall come home soon,” and
the unwilling creature followed her with his
brown eyes, and whined that he could not go
also. Later in the afternoon he was let out of
doors, and soon disappeared.</p>

<p>When Miss Benson returned her first word
was, “Douglas! Douglas!” but there was no
response to her call. He had followed her, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
lost the trail, and had gone too far to find his
way back to his home. In vain she called for
her pet. She left the door ajar, hoping at
nightfall she should hear the patter of his feet,
or his eager bark to come in, but he did not
come. She wondered where he slept, if he
slept at all; thought a dozen times in the night
that she heard him crying at the door; imagined
him moaning for her, or, supperless and
exhausted, lying down by the roadside, to wait
for the sunrise to begin his fruitless journey.</p>

<p>Douglas had become that sad thing, a lost
dog. He belonged to nobody now, and both
owner and dog were desolate. Miss Benson
could scarcely go about her work. She spent
days in searching, and hired others to search,
but all was useless. For weeks she thought
Douglas might possibly come back. If she
could know that he was dead, that even would
be a consolation; but to fear he was cold and
hungry, to realize that the world is all too indifferent
to animals, unless perchance they are
our own, to imagine he might be in some medical
college, the victim of the surgeon’s knife,&mdash;all
this was bitter in the extreme. Weeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and searching did no good, and finally the
inevitable had to be accepted, though the sadness
in Miss Benson’s heart did not fade out.</p>

<p>As is ever the case, those of us who have
lost something precious become more tender
and helpful in a world full of losses. Miss Benson
welcomed and cared for every stray animal
that she found, perhaps never quite giving up
the hope that she would see gentle, great-hearted
Douglas again.</p>

<p>And what of Douglas? He ran fast at first,
eager to overtake the one to whom he was
passionately devoted. She had been gone so
long that he soon lost track of her footsteps,
and then with a dazed look he began to howl,
hoping that she would hear his voice. He lay
down to rest, but it was growing dark and he
was hungry.</p>

<p>He stopped at a large house and the servants
drove him away. He was unused to this, but
he dragged himself along to the next place.
Here a kind woman gave him something to eat,
and would have made him welcome for the
night, but he would not stay after he had eaten.
He must needs wander on, hoping to find his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
home and his beloved mistress. All night long
he tramped, lying down now and then by the
side of the road to rest a few minutes.</p>

<p>The next day was a hard one. He was
beginning to realize that he was lost. He ran
more slowly, looked eagerly at every passer-by,
and seemed half demented. At night he
stopped at a home where the lights had just
been lighted, and some pretty children seemed
flitting from room to room. He whined at the
back door.</p>

<p>A flaxen-haired little girl opened it. “Oh,
mamma,” said the child, “here is a big black
dog, and I know he is hungry! May I feed
him?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the woman, “take a whip and
send him off. I will have no lean stray dogs
about this house.”</p>

<p>“But he looks hungry, mother,” pleaded
little Emma Bascomb, “and I know he won’t
bite.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bascomb, pity it is to tell it, was a
very pious person, never failing to be present
at prayer-meetings, always deeply interested
in the heathen, and most helpful at sewing societies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the church. She never fed stray cats
or dogs, as she did not wish them to stay at
her house. She did not remember that God
made them, and that He lets not a sparrow fall
to the ground without His notice, and she forgot
that she was to emulate Him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bascomb varied her treatment of stray
dogs and cats. Sometimes she used a long
black whip, sometimes pails of water. On this
occasion she threw on Douglas, already weak
and hungry, a pail of cold water, and sent
him frightened and hurt away from her door.
Emma protested. “When I have a home of
my own, mamma,” she said, “I will never turn
away a dog or a cat hungry.” The child knew
that it was useless to say more, as a stray cat
had stayed about the house for a week, and
Mrs. Bascomb had refused to feed it, burning
up the scraps from the table lest some starving
animal might be tempted to remain. And yet
the Bascombs had family prayers, and asked
God to provide clothes for the needy and food
for the hungry!</p>

<p>Douglas was beginning to learn the sorrows
of the poor and homeless. He longed to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
some familiar face, to hear some familiar voice.
He went on and on, and it began to rain. It
was almost sleet, and the dog, used to a warm
fire, shivered and longed for shelter. Approaching
a large rambling house with a shed
attached, Douglas ran under it for cover, and
crouched down at the side under a bench. A
man came out with a lamp. Evidently he had
been drinking, for his step was unsteady. He
had come out to close the shed door, and espying
the dog gave him a kick with his hard
boot.</p>

<p>“Get out, you scoundrel! What are you
doing here?” he said gruffly, and poor Douglas
ran as though a gun had been fired at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, if there were only a home for such
lost ones!” he must have thought; but there
was none, and again the hungry and wet dog
travelled on. A wagon soon passed with two
men in it, and Douglas followed, hoping it
would lead to a home for him. “Whip him
off,” said one of the men to the other. “We’ve
got two dogs already, and my wife would never
allow a third,” and they brandished the whip in
the rear and drove on. Douglas crawled under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
a tree, and rolling himself as nearly as he could
into a round ball for warmth finally fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning he started again on his toilsome
journey. He was lame now and half sick.
Soon the houses were nearer together, and
Douglas realized that he was coming into a
city. He did not know there was little room
for dogs in an overcrowded, fashionable city.
There was little green grass to roam over, and
the rushing world did not want the bother of
animals. Perhaps, however, where there were
so many people there would be some kind
hearts, he thought.</p>

<p>He crept along and looked into the window
of a restaurant. There was a boiled ham in the
window, cake, pies, and other attractive things.
He wagged his tail a little, and looked into a
man’s face as he went in, but the man paid no
attention. Then a young lady passed, and she
said, “Poor dog!” but went on.</p>

<p>Douglas walked away and lay down in front
of a store, but a man came and said, “Get out!
The ladies will be afraid of you.”</p>

<p>Douglas looked no longer the petted, handsome
creature of several days before. The dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
had settled in his black hair, which looked rough
and coarse. He was thin and dejected. An
unthinking boy chased him, and threw something
at him, and as he was too peaceable to
resent it he hurried along an alley and tried to
hide up a stairway. A big red-faced man came
out of a room at the head of the stairs and
kicked him down the steps.</p>

<p>Douglas ran into a shoe-store. Three men
cornered him with a broom and a pole, and one
man, braver than the others, put a cloth over
his head, and then seized him by the hind legs
and threw him into the street. Then somebody
on the sidewalk said, “That dog acts strangely.
He must be mad!”</p>

<p>That was enough to excite the passers-by,
who had read in the papers various accounts of
supposed cases of rabies. “He is weak,” said
one person, “and he totters.” “He is frothing
at the mouth,” said another. A boot-black ran
after him and threw his box at the thoroughly
frightened animal. A crowd gathered, and ran
and shouted. “Shoot him! Shoot him!” was
the eager cry.</p>

<p>Douglas did indeed froth at the mouth from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
excessive running. A lady hurried along and
said, “Let me have the dog. He is not mad,
but has lost his owner. Frothing at the mouth
is not a sign of hydrophobia, as the best physicians
will tell you.”</p>

<p>“No, madam,” said a looker-on. “Don’t
touch the dog. We men will not allow you
to be bitten.”</p>

<p>A policeman fired his pistol, and the ball
entered Douglas’s shoulder. Half dead with
pain as well as fright, the dog rushed on and
finally escaped.</p>

<p>He lay in his hiding-place till midnight, and
then when no human eye could see him he
crept away from the city. If only Miss Benson
could see him now, and dress his wounds,
and say the petting words of old that he had
so loved to hear!</p>

<p>Towards morning, exhausted, he lay down by
the fence in the front yard of a house in the
outskirts of the city. The owner of the home
was a lawyer, a kind-hearted man, in part because
he had a noble mother and wife.</p>

<p>“There’s a poor wounded dog on our lawn,
Jeannette,” Mr. Goodman said to his wife. “Call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
him in at the back door, and we’ll see if we
can’t help him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodman took a basin of warm water
and castile soap and carefully washed the wound,
the children standing about and anxiously
watching the operation. “Nice dog,” said
Teddy, a boy of five. “He no bite.”</p>

<p>“No,” said his mother, as Douglas looked
pitifully up into her face. “He is a kind dog,
and must belong to a good home somewhere.”</p>

<p>After she had finished washing the sore and
tender place Douglas licked her hand in appreciation.
“Have Dr. Thayer come in,”&mdash;he
was the veterinary surgeon,&mdash;said Mrs. Goodman
to her husband. “We might as well make
the care of animals a part of our missionary
work in the world. The doctor will find the ball,
if it is still there, and save the dog, I hope.”</p>

<p>“All right, wife,” said Mr. Goodman, as he
started for the office.</p>

<p>“I suppose you want some breakfast,
doggie,” said Mrs. Goodman, and she placed
before Douglas a dish of meat and of milk.
Douglas was too tired and too full of pain to
eat much, but he felt as though a new world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
had opened to him. After all, there were some
good people in the land, and at last he had
reached them.</p>

<p>Dr. Thayer came, found the ball in the
patient, abused animal, and the wounded
shoulder soon began to heal.</p>

<p>When night came Mrs. Goodman made
Douglas a warm bed of blankets by the kitchen
stove, for she knew that a cold kennel was not
a suitable place for him. Later he was washed
and dried, by rubbing with cloths, till his coat
was silky and black.</p>

<p>Teddy and the dog became inseparable companions.
Wherever the child went Douglas
was always close behind him, now licking his
extended hand, now lying down for the child
to clamber over him, or to lay his dark curls
against the darker curls of the dog. They
shared their food, and they frequently went to
sleep together, if it could be called sleep on the
part of the dog, whose eyes were usually open
that his little charge might be guarded. Douglas
never showed an inclination to bite unless
some one touched the boy, and then he growled
and looked concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>One summer day Teddy and a playmate
wandered off with the dog during Mrs. Goodman’s
absence. They sat down under a tree
and all three lunched together. Then they
played along the meadow till the banks of a
river were reached. Two men were working
near by and occasionally watched the children
at their play, as they dabbled their hands in the
water. Finally they heard a child scream, and
before they could reach the place Douglas was
dragging Teddy, dripping and frightened, from
the river. The men carried the boy home to
his awe-struck but overjoyed parents, and
Douglas, wet and excited, was praised for his
heroic conduct.</p>

<p>A year later, when Teddy went to school,
Douglas missed his comrade, and for days
whined piteously. He never failed to go, at
the regular hour for closing school, to meet his
little friend, and always brought home in his
teeth the dinner basket of the lad. Sometimes
Douglas whined in his sleep, as though he were
dreaming of other days, but love for Teddy
made him, on the whole, very happy.</p>

<p>When Teddy was seven years old diphtheria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
raged in the school, and marked him for one of
its victims. No love or care could save him.</p>

<p>When conscious, he could not bear Douglas
out of his sight or reach. As in the case with
his former mistress, Douglas neither ate nor
slept. When all was over he disappeared.
Where he went nobody knew. Probably he
lay upon the grave of the child, and later
wandered off, thinking perchance to find again
his first love.</p>

<p>The Goodmans had intended to leave their
home in the suburbs and move to the city
before their boy died, and now Mrs. Goodman
was anxious to go away from the place as
quickly as possible. A home was soon
obtained, and the family moved thither. They
deeply regretted that Douglas could not be
found to go with them, because they were
much attached to him for his own sake, and
because he was so dear to their child.</p>

<p>Douglas meantime had hunted far and wide
for his lost ones. He had the same bitter
experience of neglect and hunger, but a dog’s
love is his strongest quality, and despite suffering
he was seeking his own. Miss Benson he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
could not find; that was past hope, but Teddy,
perhaps, he might see again. Probably
Douglas did not know that death has no
awakening in this world, and that Teddy could
never come to his home, but the dog finally
stole back to the porch and yard where they
had played together and waited, hoping that
the boy would come. The house was vacant.
Some neighbors saw him on the steps, but he
went away again. Finally a policeman saw
him and heard him howl.</p>

<p>“Whose dog is that?” he said to a neighbor.</p>

<p>“It’s a dog that came to the Goodmans and
disappeared when their little boy died. I suppose
he has come back to find the child,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the man, “and he hasn’t any
collar on his neck. He is unlicensed. I will
send the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals after him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that he doesn’t starve,” said the
woman. “Will the Society find a home for
him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they can’t find homes for so many
as they take off the streets! They’ll kill him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“He isn’t to blame for not being licensed.
I don’t see the use of the license law, because
it means the death of so many thousands of
animals.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said the kind-hearted policeman.
“Poor folks can’t always pay the fee. I
love my dog, and he’s a great comfort to my
children. But I don’t make the law. I only
help to enforce it.”</p>

<p>“What is done with the license money? It
makes so much heartache it ought to do great
good.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that it is given sometimes to
public schools and to libraries to buy books on
kindness to animals, and sometimes to the
Humane Society so that they can pay men to
catch and kill unlicensed dogs. You see, the
licensed dogs help to kill the unlicensed and
homeless,” said the man.</p>

<p>“I should think a better way would be to
provide homes for the really homeless instead
of killing them. I think that we have a duty
to animals, seeing that they are under our protection.”</p>

<p>The policeman told the S. P. C. A. that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
black unlicensed dog was howling on the steps
of a vacant house because his little friend had
died. Two officers in a big wagon hastened to
the spot, caught him, and threw him in with a
score of other animals which they had seized
on the street.</p>

<p>Douglas cowered in the corner, and wondered
what new sorrow had befallen him. The other
poor things were as frightened as himself. Two
were black and white puppies scarcely bigger
than kittens, and two were pretty black-and-tan
pets. A large mastiff looked out of her
great brown eyes, trembling from head to foot.
One shepherd dog was poor and thin, but most
looked well cared for, only they had no collars,
and their owners had not paid their license fee.</p>

<p>The wagon soon reached a barn-like structure,
and the animals were hastily emptied into
a pen with sawdust on the floor. What was in
store for them they could only guess. After a
time they were offered a mixture of meal and
meat, but most were too frightened to eat.</p>

<p>All the next day they listened for footsteps,
hoping that some friend would come for them.
Douglas lay in the corner and expected nobody.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Miss Benson did not know where he
was, and Teddy had never come back when he
howled for him.</p>

<p>There was a large pen adjoining that of
Douglas, and this was filled with dogs&mdash;fox-terriers,
some black like himself, and several
yellow ones. Cats, many of them large and
handsome, were in cages about the room.
Some animals had been brought to the pound,
or refuge, by persons who did not or could not
take the trouble to find homes for them. An
advertisement in the paper saying that a dog had
been found and would be given to a good home
would in almost every case have met with responses,
but this cost a little money and time.</p>

<p>A boy brought in two pretty creatures, one
red and the other yellow, which he said he had
found without collars. A woman had hired
him and other children by paying each a few
cents to do this work, which meant almost certain
death to animals, believing, probably, that
she was doing good.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Douglas witnessed a
strange, sad sight. Every cat, fifty or more,
was thrown into a large cage, and poisonous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
gas turned in upon them. The terrified creatures
huddled together, as though they knew
their helplessness in the hands of their destroyers,
and died.</p>

<p>Then several men, as soon as the cats were
removed, threw the shrinking, crying dogs into
the cage, and they too were soon dead, piled
upon each other. Douglas and the rest knew
that their turn would come soon.</p>

<p>On the second day a lady called at the
refuge because her own city contemplated
establishing a home (?) where dogs could be
killed, the license fees to be used to pay the
salaries of the S. P. C. A. agents. Her heart
was touched by the appealing looks of the
helpless animals. She went away and found
homes for two fox-terriers, paid the license fees
and fines, and the dogs were released, licking
her hands, as though they realized from what
they had been saved.</p>

<p>Douglas crept towards the visitor, because he
had been used to a woman’s voice. He was
thin, but his eyes were as beautiful as when he
was a puppy and responded to the petting of
Miss Benson’s gentle hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have been a handsome dog,” the lady
said to Douglas, “and somebody has loved
you. I know of a place for you. A noble
woman who loves dogs has provided a home
for the homeless, as far as her means will allow,
and is devoting her life to the care of such of
God’s creatures as you are. Would you like to
go with me?”</p>

<p>Douglas whined, and the other poor animals
crowded around as much as to say, “Can you
not take us too, and save us from death to-morrow?
We cannot pay the license, but we would
love and protect anybody who would pay it
and take us home.” The lady could not take
them all&mdash;the city and State, by reason of their
wealth and humaneness, instead of license or
tax, should provide homes for those committed
to their keeping by the Creator. Douglas was
let out, and followed the lady with a thankful
heart, but with a downcast look, as though life
had been so uncertain that he could not be
sure of anything good in the future.</p>

<p>The lady hired a cab, and the dog lay at her
feet. They were driven to an attractive-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
brick house, with several small buildings adjoining.
A young girl came to the door.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to see the matron of the
Dogs’ Home?” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am a friend of the matron,” said the
lady, “and I have taken a fancy to a homeless
dog and have brought him here to find a
home.”</p>

<p>The matron soon appeared, and, with one
wild cry, Douglas sprang into her arms. It
was Miss Benson, who, since she had lost Douglas,
had been moved to spend her life and her
fortune for other dogs who were lost.</p>

<p>“Oh, Douglas! Douglas!” she exclaimed,
while the visitor looked on with amazement.
“Have you found me and I you at last?”
And the dog whined and caressed her till she
feared he would die from excess of joy unless
she calmed him.</p>

<p>“You and I will never be parted again.
You shall live here and help care for other lost
and unwanted ones.”</p>

<p>For years Douglas thankfully shared in the
care and love of his mistress. She could not
bear to see him grow old, but he had suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
too much to live to the usual age of St. Bernards.
When he died his head was in Miss
Benson’s lap, and his great brown eyes looked
upon her face and whitening hair as the last
precious thing to be seen in life. She buried
him and laid flowers upon his grave, for was he
not her devoted, loyal friend? A neat headstone
tells where faithful Douglas sleeps.
